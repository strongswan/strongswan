<DD>Using three<A href="#DES"> DES</A> encryptions on a single data
 block, with at least two different keys, to get higher security than is
 available from a single DES pass. The three-key version of 3DES is the
 default encryption algorithm for<A href="web.html#FreeSWAN"> Linux
 FreeS/WAN</A>.
<P><A href="#IPSEC">IPsec</A> always does 3DES with three different
 keys, as required by RFC 2451. For an explanation of the two-key
 variant, see<A href="#2key"> two key triple DES</A>. Both use an<A href="#EDE">
 EDE</A> encrypt-decrypt-encrpyt sequence of operations.</P>
<P>Single<A href="#DES"> DES</A> is<A href="politics.html#desnotsecure">
 insecure</A>.</P>
<P>Double DES is ineffective. Using two 56-bit keys, one might expect an
 attacker to have to do 2<SUP>112</SUP> work to break it. In fact, only
 2<SUP>57</SUP> work is required with a<A href="#meet">
 meet-in-the-middle attack</A>, though a large amount of memory is also
 required. Triple DES is vulnerable to a similar attack, but that just
 reduces the work factor from the 2<SUP>168</SUP> one might expect to 2<SUP>
112</SUP>. That provides adequate protection against<A href="#brute">
 brute force</A> attacks, and no better attack is known.</P>
<P>3DES can be somewhat slow compared to other ciphers. It requires
 three DES encryptions per block. DES was designed for hardware
 implementation and includes some operations which are difficult in
 software. However, the speed we get is quite acceptable for many uses.
 See our<A href="performance.html"> performance</A> document for

 1998 and subjected to intense discussion and analysis, &quot;round one&quot;

<DT><A name="authentication">Authentication</A></DT>
<DD>Ensuring that a message originated from the expected sender and has
 not been altered on route.<A href="#IPSEC"> IPsec</A> uses
 authentication in two places:
<UL>
<LI>peer authentication, authenticating the players in<A href="#IKE">
 IKE</A>'s<A href="#DH"> Diffie-Hellman</A> key exchanges to prevent<A href="#middle">
 man-in-the-middle attacks</A>. This can be done in a number of ways.
 The methods supported by FreeS/WAN are discussed in our<A href="adv_config.html#choose">
 advanced configuration</A> document.</LI>
<LI>packet authentication, authenticating packets on an established<A href="#SA">
 SA</A>, either with a separate<A href="#AH"> authentication header</A>
 or with the optional authentication in the<A href="#ESP"> ESP</A>
 protocol. In either case, packet authentication uses a<A href="#HMAC">
 hashed message athentication code</A> technique.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Outside IPsec, passwords are perhaps the most common authentication
 mechanism. Their function is essentially to authenticate the person's
 identity to the system. Passwords are generally only as secure as the
 network they travel over. If you send a cleartext password over a
 tapped phone line or over a network with a packet sniffer on it, the
 security provided by that password becomes zero. Sending an encrypted
 password is no better; the attacker merely records it and reuses it at
 his convenience. This is called a<A href="#replay"> replay</A> attack.</P>
<P>A common solution to this problem is a<A href="#challenge">
 challenge-response</A> system. This defeats simple eavesdropping and
 replay attacks. Of course an attacker might still try to break the
 cryptographic algorithm used, or the<A href="#random"> random number</A>
 generator.</P>
</DD>
<DT><A name="auto">Automatic keying</A></DT>
<DD>A mode in which keys are automatically generated at connection
 establisment and new keys automaically created periodically thereafter.
 Contrast with<A href="ipsec.html#manual"> manual keying</A> in which a
 single stored key is used.
<P>IPsec uses the<A href="#DH"> Diffie-Hellman key exchange protocol</A>
 to create keys. An<A href="#authentication"> authentication</A>
 mechansim is required for this. FreeS/WAN normally uses<A href="#RSA">
 RSA</A> for this. Other methods supported are discussed in our<A href="adv_config.html#choose">
 advanced configuration</A> document.</P>
<P>Having an attacker break the authentication is emphatically not a
 good idea. An attacker that breaks authentication, and manages to
 subvert some other network entities (DNS, routers or gateways), can use
 a<A href="#middle"> man-in-the middle attack</A> to break the security
 of your IPsec connections.</P>
<P>However, having an attacker break the authentication in automatic
 keying is not quite as bad as losing the key in manual keying.</P>
<UL>
<LI>An attacker who reads /etc/ipsec.conf and gets the keys for a
 manually keyed connection can, without further effort, read all
 messages encrypted with those keys, including any old messages he may
 have archived.</LI>
<LI>Automatic keying has a property called<A href="#PFS"> perfect
 forward secrecy</A>. An attacker who breaks the authentication gets
 none of the automatically generated keys and cannot immediately read
 any messages. He has to mount a successful<A href="#middle">
 man-in-the-middle attack</A> in real time before he can read anything.
 He cannot read old archived messages at all and will not be able to
 read any future messages not caught by man-in-the-middle tricks.</LI>
</UL>
<P>That said, the secrets used for authentication, stored in<A href="manpage.d/ipsec.secrets.5.html">
 ipsec.secrets(5)</A>, should still be protected as tightly as
 cryptographic keys.</P>

 fact. In a group of 23 people, the chance of a least one pair having
 the same birthday is over 50%.
<P>The second person has 1 chance in 365 (ignoring leap years) of
 matching the first. If they don't match, the third person's chances of
 matching one of them are 2/365. The 4th, 3/365, and so on. The total of
 these chances grows more quickly than one might guess.</P>
</DD>
<DT><A name="block">Block cipher</A></DT>
<DD>A<A href="#symmetric"> symmetric cipher</A> which operates on
 fixed-size blocks of plaintext, giving a block of ciphertext for each.
 Contrast with<A href="#stream"> stream cipher</A>. Block ciphers can be
 used in various<A href="#mode"> modes</A> when multiple block are to be
 encrypted.
<P><A href="#DES">DES</A> is among the the best known and widely used

 up to 448 bits, designed by<A href="biblio.html#schneier"> Bruce
 Schneier</A> and used in several products.

 currently used in<A href="web.html#FreeSWAN"> Linux FreeS/WAN</A>.</P>
</DD>
<DT><A name="brute">Brute force attack (exhaustive search)</A></DT>
<DD>Breaking a cipher by trying all possible keys. This is always
 possible in theory (except against a<A href="#OTP"> one-time pad</A>),
 but it becomes practical only if the key size is inadequate. For an
 important example, see our document on the<A href="politics.html#desnotsecure">
 insecurity of DES</A> with its 56-bit key. For an analysis of key sizes
 required to resist plausible brute force attacks, see<A href="http://www.counterpane.com/keylength.html">
 this paper</A>.
<P>Longer keys protect against brute force attacks. Each extra bit in
 the key doubles the number of possible keys and therefore doubles the
 work a brute force attack must do. A large enough key defeats<STRONG>
 any</STRONG> brute force attack.</P>
<P>For example, the EFF's<A href="#EFF"> DES Cracker</A> searches a
 56-bit key space in an average of a few days. Let us assume an attacker
 that can find a 64-bit key (256 times harder) by brute force search in
 a second (a few hundred thousand times faster). For a 96-bit key, that
 attacker needs 2<SUP>32</SUP> seconds, about 135 years. Against a
 128-bit key, he needs 2<SUP>32</SUP> times that, over 500,000,000,000
 years. Your data is then obviously secure against brute force attacks.
 Even if our estimate of the attacker's speed is off by a factor of a
 million, it still takes him over 500,000 years to crack a message.</P>
<P>This is why</P>
<UL>
<LI>single<A href="#DES"> DES</A> is now considered<A href="politics.html#desnotsecure">

<LI><A href="#AES">AES</A> ciphers support keysizes 128, 192 and 256
 bits</LI>
<LI>any cipher we add to Linux FreeS/WAN will have<EM> at least</EM> a
 128-bit key</LI>
</UL>
<P><STRONG>Cautions:</STRONG>
<BR><EM> Inadequate keylength always indicates a weak cipher</EM> but it
 is important to note that<EM> adequate keylength does not necessarily
 indicate a strong cipher</EM>. There are many attacks other than brute
 force, and adequate keylength<EM> only</EM> guarantees resistance to
 brute force. Any cipher, whatever its key size, will be weak if design
 or implementation flaws allow other attacks.</P>
<P>Also,<EM> once you have adequate keylength</EM> (somewhere around 90
 or 100 bits),<EM> adding more key bits make no practical difference</EM>
, even against brute force. Consider our 128-bit example above that
 takes 500,000,000,000 years to break by brute force. We really don't
 care how many zeroes there are on the end of that, as long as the
 number remains ridiculously large. That is, we don't care exactly how
 large the key is as long as it is large enough.</P>
<P>There may be reasons of convenience in the design of the cipher to
 support larger keys. For example<A href="#Blowfish"> Blowfish</A>
 allows up to 448 bits and<A href="#RC4"> RC4</A> up to 2048, but beyond
 100-odd bits it makes no difference to practical security.</P>

<DT><A name="challenge">Challenge-response authentication</A></DT>
<DD>An<A href="#authentication"> authentication</A> system in which one
 player generates a<A href="#random"> random number</A>, encrypts it and
 sends the result as a challenge. The other player decrypts and sends
 back the result. If the result is correct, that proves to the first
 player that the second player knew the appropriate secret, required for
 the decryption. Variations on this technique exist using<A href="#public">
 public key</A> or<A href="#symmetric"> symmetric</A> cryptography. Some
 provide two-way authentication, assuring each player of the other's
 identity.
<P>This is more secure than passwords against two simple attacks:</P>
<UL>
<LI>If cleartext passwords are sent across the wire (e.g. for telnet),
 an eavesdropper can grab them. The attacker may even be able to break
 into other systems if the user has chosen the same password for them.</LI>
<LI>If an encrypted password is sent, an attacker can record the
 encrypted form and use it later. This is called a replay attack.</LI>
</UL>
<P>A challenge-response system never sends a password, either cleartext
 or encrypted. An attacker cannot record the response to one challenge
 and use it as a response to a later challenge. The random number is
 different each time.</P>
<P>Of course an attacker might still try to break the cryptographic
 algorithm used, or the<A href="#random"> random number</A> generator.</P>

<DT><A name="DOS">Denial of service (DoS) attack</A></DT>
<DD>An attack that aims at denying some service to legitimate users of a
 system, rather than providing a service to the attacker.
<UL>
<LI>One variant is a flooding attack, overwhelming the system with too
 many packets, to much email, or whatever.</LI>
<LI>A closely related variant is a resource exhaustion attack. For
 example, consider a &quot;TCP SYN flood&quot; attack. Setting up a TCP connection
 involves a three-packet exchange:
<UL>
<LI>Initiator: Connection please (SYN)</LI>
<LI>Responder: OK (ACK)</LI>
<LI>Initiator: OK here too</LI>
</UL>
<P>If the attacker puts bogus source information in the first packet,
 such that the second is never delivered, the responder may wait a long
 time for the third to come back. If responder has already allocated
 memory for the connection data structures, and if many of these bogus
 packets arrive, the responder may run out of memory.</P>
</LI>
<LI>Another variant is to feed the system undigestible data, hoping to
 make it sick. For example, IP packets are limited in size to 64K bytes
 and a fragment carries information on where it starts within that 64K
 and how long it is. The &quot;ping of death&quot; delivers fragments that say,
 for example, that they start at 60K and are 20K long. Attempting to
 re-assemble these without checking for overflow can be fatal.</LI>
</UL>
<P>The two example attacks discussed were both quite effective when
 first discovered, capable of crashing or disabling many operating
 systems. They were also well-publicised, and today far fewer systems
 are vulnerable to them.</P>

<DD>A protocol that allows two parties without any initial shared secret

 key for a block cipher or as the basis for key exchange.
<P>The protocol is secure against all<A href="#passive"> passive attacks</A>

 discussed in our<A href="config.html#choose"> configuration</A>

<P>The Diffie-Hellman key exchange is based on the<A href="#dlog">

<P>Now Alice and Bob can both calculate the shared secret<VAR> s =

<DT><A name="dlog">discrete logarithm problem</A></DT>
<DD>The problem of finding logarithms in a finite field. Given a field
 defintion (such definitions always include some operation analogous to
 multiplication) and two numbers, a base and a target, find the power
 which the base must be raised to in order to yield the target.
<P>The discrete log problem is the basis of several cryptographic
 systems, including the<A href="#DH"> Diffie-Hellman</A> key exchange
 used in the<A href="#IKE"> IKE</A> protocol. The useful property is
 that exponentiation is relatively easy but the inverse operation,
 finding the logarithm, is hard. The cryptosystems are designed so that
 the user does only easy operations (exponentiation in the field) but an
 attacker must solve the hard problem (discrete log) to crack the
 system.</P>
<P>There are several variants of the problem for different types of
 field. The IKE/Oakley key determination protocol uses two variants,
 either over a field modulo a prime or over a field defined by an
 elliptic curve. We give an example modulo a prime below. For the
 elliptic curve version, consult an advanced text such as<A href="biblio.html#handbook">
 Handbook of Applied Cryptography</A>.</P>
<P>Given a prime<VAR> p</VAR>, a generator<VAR> g</VAR> for the field
 modulo that prime, and a number<VAR> x</VAR> in the field, the problem
 is to find<VAR> y</VAR> such that<VAR> g^y = x</VAR>.</P>
<P>For example, let p = 13. The field is then the integers from 0 to 12.
 Any integer equals one of these modulo 13. That is, the remainder when
 any integer is divided by 13 must be one of these.</P>
<P>2 is a generator for this field. That is, the powers of two modulo 13
 run through all the non-zero numbers in the field. Modulo 13 we have:</P>
<PRE>          y      x
        2^0  ==  1
        2^1  ==  2
        2^2  ==  4
        2^3  ==  8
        2^4  ==  3 that is, the remainder from 16/13 is 3
        2^5  ==  6          the remainder from 32/13 is 6
        2^6  == 12 and so on
        2^7  == 11
        2^8  ==  9
        2^9  ==  5
        2^10 == 10
        2^11 ==  7
        2^12 ==  1</PRE>
<P>Exponentiation in such a field is not difficult. Given, say,<NOBR><VAR>
 y = 11</VAR>,calculating<NOBR><VAR> x = 7</VAR>is straightforward. One
 method is just to calculate<NOBR><VAR> 2^11 = 2048</VAR>,then<NOBR><VAR>
 2048 mod 13 == 7</VAR>.When the field is modulo a large prime (say a
 few 100 digits) you need a silghtly cleverer method and even that is
 moderately expensive in computer time, but the calculation is still not
 problematic in any basic way.</P>
<P>The discrete log problem is the reverse. In our example, given<NOBR><VAR>
 x = 7</VAR>,find the logarithm<NOBR><VAR> y = 11</VAR>.When the field
 is modulo a large prime (or is based on a suitable elliptic curve),
 this is indeed problematic. No solution method that is not
 catastrophically expensive is known. Quite a few mathematicians have
 tackled this problem. No efficient method has been found and
 mathematicians do not expect that one will be. It seems likely no
 efficient solution to either of the main variants the discrete log
 problem exists.</P>
<P>Note, however, that no-one has proven such methods do not exist. If a
 solution to either variant were found, the security of any crypto
 system using that variant would be destroyed. This is one reason<A href="#IKE">
 IKE</A> supports two variants. If one is broken, we can switch to the
 other.</P>

<DD>An<A href="#active"> active attack</A> in which the attacker

<P>For example, if<A href="#alicebob"> Alice and Bob</A> are negotiating
 a key via the<A href="#DH"> Diffie-Hellman</A> key agreement, and are
 not using<A href="#authentication"> authentication</A> to be certain
 they are talking to each other, then an attacker able to insert himself
 in the communication path can deceive both players.</P>
<P>Call the attacker Mallory. For Bob, he pretends to be Alice. For
 Alice, he pretends to be Bob. Two keys are then negotiated,
 Alice-to-Mallory and Bob-to-Mallory. Alice and Bob each think the key
 they have is Alice-to-Bob.</P>
<P>A message from Alice to Bob then goes to Mallory who decrypts it,
 reads it and/or saves a copy, re-encrypts using the Bob-to-Mallory key
 and sends it along to Bob. Bob decrypts successfully and sends a reply
 which Mallory decrypts, reads, re-encrypts and forwards to Alice.</P>
<P>To make this attack effective, Mallory must</P>
<UL>
<LI>subvert some part of the network in some way that lets him carry out
 the deception
<BR> possible targets: DNS, router, Alice or Bob's machine, mail server,
 ...</LI>
<LI>beat any authentication mechanism Alice and Bob use
<BR> strong authentication defeats the attack entirely; this is why<A href="#IKE">
 IKE</A> requires authentication</LI>
<LI>work in real time, delivering messages without introducing a delay
 large enough to alert the victims
<BR> not hard if Alice and Bob are using email; quite difficult in some
 situations.</LI>

</DD>
<DT><A name="meet">Meet-in-the-middle attack</A></DT>
<DD>A divide-and-conquer attack which breaks a cipher into two parts,
 works against each separately, and compares results. Probably the best
 known example is an attack on double DES. This applies in principle to
 any pair of block ciphers, e.g. to an encryption system using, say,
 CAST-128 and Blowfish, but we will describe it for double DES.
<P>Double DES encryption and decryption can be written:</P>
<PRE>        C = E(k2,E(k1,P))
        P = D(k1,D(k2,C))</PRE>
<P>Where C is ciphertext, P is plaintext, E is encryption, D is
 decryption, k1 is one key, and k2 is the other key. If we know a P, C
 pair, we can try and find the keys with a brute force attack, trying
 all possible k1, k2 pairs. Since each key is 56 bits, there are 2<SUP>
112</SUP> such pairs and this attack is painfully inefficient.</P>
<P>The meet-in-the middle attack re-writes the equations to calculate a
 middle value M:</P>
<PRE>        M = E(k1,P)
        M = D(k2,C)</PRE>
<P>Now we can try some large number of D(k2,C) decryptions with various
 values of k2 and store the results in a table. Then start doing E(k1,P)
 encryptions, checking each result to see if it is in the table.</P>
<P>With enough table space, this breaks double DES with<NOBR> 2<SUP>56</SUP>
 + 2<SUP>56</SUP> = 2<SUP>57</SUP>work. Against triple DES, you need<NOBR>
 2<SUP>56</SUP> + 2<SUP>112</SUP> ~= 2<SUP>112</SUP>.</P>
<P>The memory requirements for such attacks can be prohibitive, but
 there is a whole body of research literature on methods of reducing
 them.</P>

<DT><A name="digest">Message Digest Algorithm</A></DT>

 contents in some highly complex manner. Design criteria include making
 it extremely difficult for anyone to counterfeit a digest or to change
 a message without altering its digest. One essential property is<A href="#collision">

<DD><STRONG>M</STRONG>aximum<STRONG> T</STRONG>ransmission<STRONG> U</STRONG>
nit, the largest size of packet that can be sent over a link. This is
 determined by the underlying network, but must be taken account of at
 the IP level.
<P>IP packets, which can be up to 64K bytes each, must be packaged into
 lower-level packets of the appropriate size for the underlying
 network(s) and re-assembled on the other end. When a packet must pass
 over multiple networks, each with its own MTU, and many of the MTUs are
 unknown to the sender, this becomes a fairly complex problem. See<A href="#pathMTU">
 path MTU discovery</A> for details.</P>
<P>Often the MTU is a few hundred bytes on serial links and 1500 on
 Ethernet. There are, however, serial link protocols which use a larger
 MTU to avoid fragmentation at the ethernet/serial boundary, and newer
 (especially gigabit) Ethernet networks sometimes support much larger
 packets because these are more efficient in some applications.</P>

 message in hand has no better chance of guessing the message than an
 attacker who has not intercepted the message and only knows the message
 length. No such proof exists for any other cipher.</P>
<P>There are, however, several problems with this &quot;perfect&quot; cipher.</P>
<P>First, it is<STRONG> wildly impractical</STRONG> for most
 applications. Key management is at best difficult, often completely
 impossible.</P>
<P>Second, it is<STRONG> extremely fragile</STRONG>. Small changes which
 violate the conditions listed above do not just weaken the cipher
 liitle. Quite often they destroy its security completely.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Re-using the pad weakens the cipher to the point where it can be
 broken with pencil and paper. With a computer, the attack is trivially
 easy.</LI>
<LI>Using<EM> anything</EM> less than truly<A href="#random"> random</A>
 numbers<EM> completely</EM> invalidates the security proof.</LI>
<LI>In particular, using computer-generated pseudo-random numbers may
 give an extremely weak cipher. It might also produce a good stream
 cipher, if the pseudo-random generator is both well-designed and
 properely seeded.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Marketing claims about the &quot;unbreakable&quot; security of various products
 which somewhat resemble one-time pads are common. Such claims are one
 of the surest signs of cryptographic<A href="#snake"> snake oil</A>;
 most systems marketed with such claims are worthless.</P>
<P>Finally, even if the system is implemented and used correctly, it is<STRONG>
 highly vulnerable to a substitution attack</STRONG>. If an attacker
 knows some plaintext and has an intercepted message, he can discover
 the pad.</P>
<UL>
<LI>This does not matter if the attacker is just a<A href="#passive">
 passive</A> eavesdropper. It gives him no plaintext he didn't already
 know and we don't care that he learns a pad which we will never re-use.</LI>
<LI>However, an<A href="#active"> active</A> attacker who knows the
 plaintext can recover the pad, then use it to encode with whatever he
 chooses. If he can get his version delivered instead of yours, this may
 be a disaster. If you send &quot;attack at dawn&quot;, the delivered message can
 be anything the same length -- perhaps &quot;retreat to east&quot; or &quot;shoot
 generals&quot;.</LI>
<LI>An active attacker with only a reasonable guess at the plaintext can
 try the same attack. If the guess is correct, this works and the
 attacker's bogus message is delivered. If the guess is wrong, a garbled
 message is delivered.</LI>
</UL>
<P>In general then, despite its theoretical perfection, the one-time-pad
 has very limited practical application.</P>

<DT><A name="pathMTU">Path MTU discovery</A></DT>
<DD>The process of discovering the largest packet size which all links
 on a path can handle without fragmentation -- that is, without any
 router having to break the packet up into smaller pieces to match the<A href="#MTU">
 MTU</A> of its outgoing link.
<P>This is done as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>originator sends the largest packets allowed by<A href="#MTU"> MTU</A>
 of the first link, setting the DF (<STRONG>d</STRONG>on't<STRONG> f</STRONG>

<LI>any router which cannot send the packet on (outgoing MTU is too
 small for it, and DF prevents fragmenting it to match) sends back an<A href="#ICMP.gloss">

<LI>originator looks at ICMP message and tries a smaller size</LI>
<LI>eventually, you settle on a size that can pass all routers</LI>
<LI>thereafter, originator just sends that size and no-one has to
 fragment</LI>
</UL>
<P>Since this requires co-operation of many systems, and since the next
 packet may travel a different path, this is one of the trickier areas
 of IP programming. Bugs that have shown up over the years have
 included:</P>
<UL>
<LI>malformed ICMP messages</LI>
<LI>hosts that ignore or mishandle these ICMP messages</LI>

 allow him to infer those. Of course, it may allow him to conduct
 another attack (such as<A href="#middle"> man-in-the-middle</A>) which
 gives him some short-term keys, but he does not automatically get them
 just by acquiring the long-term key.</P>

 September 2000.
<P>RSA can be used to provide either<A href="#encryption"> encryption</A>
 or<A href="#signature"> digital signatures</A>. In IPsec, it is used
 only for signatures. These provide gateway-to-gateway<A href="#authentication">

<P>For a full explanation of the algorithm, consult one of the standard
 references such as<A href="biblio.html#schneier"> Applied Cryptography</A>
. A simple explanation is:</P>
<P>The great 17th century French mathematician<A href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Fermat.html">
 Fermat</A> proved that,</P>
<P>for any prime p and number x, 0 &lt;= x &lt; p:</P>
<PRE>        x^p == x         modulo p
        x^(p-1) == 1     modulo p, non-zero x
      </PRE>
<P>From this it follows that if we have a pair of primes p, q and two
 numbers e, d such that:</P>
<PRE>        ed == 1          modulo lcm( p-1, q-1)
      </PRE>
 where lcm() is least common multiple, then
<BR> for all x, 0 &lt;= x &lt; pq:
<PRE>      x^ed == x           modulo pq
      </PRE>
<P>So we construct such as set of numbers p, q, e, d and publish the
 product N=pq and e as the public key. Using c for<A href="#ciphertext">
 ciphertext</A> and i for the input<A href="#plaintext"> plaintext</A>,
 encryption is then:</P>
<PRE>        c = i^e           modulo N
      </PRE>
<P>An attacker cannot deduce i from the cyphertext c, short of either
 factoring N or solving the<A href="#dlog"> discrete logarithm</A>
 problem for this field. If p, q are large primes (hundreds or thousands
 of bits) no efficient solution to either problem is known.</P>
<P>The receiver, knowing the private key (N and d), can readily recover
 the plaintext p since:</P>
<PRE>        c^d == (i^e)^d    modulo N
            == i^ed       modulo N
            == i          modulo N
      </PRE>
<P>This gives an effective public key technique, with only a couple of
 problems. It uses a good deal of computer time, since calculations with
 large integers are not cheap, and there is no proof it is necessarily
 secure since no-one has proven either factoring or discrete log cannot
 be done efficiently. Quite a few good mathematicians have tried both
 problems, and no-one has announced success, but there is no proof they
 are insoluble.</P>

<DT><A name="subnet">subnet</A></DT>
<DD>A group of IP addresses which are logically one network, typically
 (but not always) assigned to a group of physically connected machines.
 The range of addresses in a subnet is described using a subnet mask.
 See next entry.</DD>
<DT>subnet mask</DT>
<DD>A method of indicating the addresses included in a subnet. Here are
 two equivalent examples:
<UL>
<LI>101.101.101.0/24</LI>
<LI>101.101.101.0 with mask 255.255.255.0</LI>
</UL>
<P>The '24' is shorthand for a mask with the top 24 bits one and the
 rest zero. This is exactly the same as 255.255.255.0 which has three
 all-ones bytes and one all-zeros byte.</P>
<P>These indicate that, for this range of addresses, the top 24 bits are
 to be treated as naming a network (often referred to as &quot;the
 101.101.101.0/24 subnet&quot;) while most combinations of the low 8 bits can
 be used to designate machines on that network. Two addresses are
 reserved; 101.101.101.0 refers to the subnet rather than a specific
 machine while 101.101.101.255 is a broadcast address. 1 to 254 are
 available for machines.</P>
<P>It is common to find subnets arranged in a hierarchy. For example, a
 large company might have a /16 subnet and allocate /24 subnets within
 that to departments. An ISP might have a large subnet and allocate /26
 subnets (64 addresses, 62 usable) to business customers and /29 subnets
 (8 addresses, 6 usable) to residential clients.</P>

<DT><A name="SWAN">S/WAN</A></DT>
<DD>Secure Wide Area Network, a project involving<A href="#RSAco"> RSA
 Data Security</A> and a number of other companies. The goal was to
 ensure that all their<A href="#IPSEC"> IPsec</A> implementations would
 interoperate so that their customers can communicate with each other
 securely.</DD>
<DT><A name="symmetric">Symmetric cryptography</A></DT>
<DD>Symmetric cryptography, also referred to as conventional or secret
 key cryptography, relies on a<EM> shared secret key</EM>, identical for
 sender and receiver. Sender encrypts with that key, receiver decrypts
 with it. The idea is that an eavesdropper without the key be unable to
 read the messages. There are two main types of symmetric cipher,<A href="#block">
 block ciphers</A> and<A href="#stream"> stream ciphers</A>.
<P>Symmetric cryptography contrasts with<A href="#public"> public key</A>
 or asymmetric systems where the two players use different keys.</P>
<P>The great difficulty in symmetric cryptography is, of course, key
 management. Sender and receiver<EM> must</EM> have identical keys and
 those keys<EM> must</EM> be kept secret from everyone else. Not too
 much of a problem if only two people are involved and they can
 conveniently meet privately or employ a trusted courier. Quite a
 problem, though, in other circumstances.</P>
<P>It gets much worse if there are many people. An application might be
 written to use only one key for communication among 100 people, for
 example, but there would be serious problems. Do you actually trust all
 of them that much? Do they trust each other that much? Should they?
 What is at risk if that key is compromised? How are you going to
 distribute that key to everyone without risking its secrecy? What do
 you do when one of them leaves the company? Will you even know?</P>
<P>On the other hand, if you need unique keys for every possible
 connection between a group of 100, then each user must have 99 keys.
 You need either 99*100/2 = 4950<EM> secure</EM> key exchanges between
 users or a central authority that<EM> securely</EM> distributes 100 key
 packets, each with a different set of 99 keys.</P>
<P>Either of these is possible, though tricky, for 100 users. Either
 becomes an administrative nightmare for larger numbers. Moreover, keys<EM>
 must</EM> be changed regularly, so the problem of key distribution
 comes up again and again. If you use the same key for many messages
 then an attacker has more text to work with in an attempt to crack that
 key. Moreover, one successful crack will give him or her the text of
 all those messages.</P>
<P>In short, the<EM> hardest part of conventional cryptography is key
 management</EM>. Today the standard solution is to build a<A href="#hybrid">
 hybrid system</A> using<A href="#public"> public key</A> techniques to
 manage keys.</P>

<DD>Deducing useful intelligence from patterns of message traffic,
 without breaking codes or reading the messages. In one case during
 World War II, the British guessed an attack was coming because all
 German radio traffic stopped. The &quot;radio silence&quot; order, intended to
 preserve security, actually gave the game away.
<P>In an industrial espionage situation, one might deduce something
 interesting just by knowing that company A and company B were talking,
 especially if one were able to tell which departments were involved, or
 if one already knew that A was looking for acquisitions and B was
 seeking funds for expansion.</P>
<P>In general, traffic analysis by itself is not very useful. However,
 in the context of a larger intelligence effort where quite a bit is
 already known, it can be very useful. When you are solving a complex
 puzzle, every little bit helps.</P>
<P><A href="#IPSEC">IPsec</A> itself does not defend against traffic
 analysis, but carefully thought out systems using IPsec can provide at
 least partial protection. In particular, one might want to encrypt more

 is<A href="#EDE"> EDE</A> or encrypt-decrypt-encrypt, but in the
 two-key variant the first and third keys are the same.
<P>3DES with three keys has 3*56 = 168 bits of key but has only 112-bit
 strength against a<A href="#meet"> meet-in-the-middle</A> attack, so it
 is possible that the two key version is just as strong. Last I looked,
 this was an open question in the research literature.</P>

 tap it. Its advocates would claim this is good design, refusing to
 build in complex features beyond the actual requirements.
<P>Critics refer to WEP as &quot;Wire<EM>tap</EM> Equivalent Privacy&quot;, and
 consider it a horribly flawed design based on bogus &quot;requirements&quot;. You
 do not control radio waves as you might control your wires, so the
 metaphor in the rationale is utterly inapplicable. A security policy
 that chooses not to invest resources in protecting against certain
 attacks which can only be conducted by people physically plugged into
 your LAN may or may not be reasonable. The same policy is completely
 unreasonable when someone can &quot;plug in&quot; from a laptop half a block
 away..</P>
<P>There has been considerable analysis indicating that WEP is seriously
 flawed. A FAQ on attacks against WEP is available. Part of it reads:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> ... attacks are practical to mount using only inexpensive
 off-the-shelf equipment. We recommend that anyone using an 802.11
 wireless network not rely on WEP for security, and employ other
 security measures to protect their wireless network. Note that our
 attacks apply to both 40-bit and the so-called 128-bit versions of WEP
 equally well.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>WEP appears to be yet another instance of governments, and
 unfortunately some vendors and standards bodies, deliberately promoting
 hopelessly flawed &quot;security&quot; products, apparently mainly for the
