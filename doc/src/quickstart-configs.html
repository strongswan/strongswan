<P>These are sample 
<A href="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html">ipsec.conf(5)</A>
configuration files for opportunistic encryption, with comments. Much of 
this configuration will be unnecessary with the new defaults proposed
for FreeS/WAN 2.x.</P>
<P>Full instructions are in our
<A href="quickstart.html#quickstart">quickstart guide</A>.

<H2><A name="qc.opp.client">Configuration for Initiate-only Opportunistic Encryption</A></H2>
<P>The ipsec.conf file for an initiate-only opportunistic setup is:</P>
<PRE># general IPsec setup
config setup
        # Use the default interface
        interfaces=%defaultroute
        # Use auto= parameters in conn descriptions to control startup actions.
        plutoload=%search
        plutostart=%search
        uniqueids=yes

# defaults for subsequent connection descriptions
conn %default
        # How to authenticate gateways
        authby=rsasig
        # default is
        # load connection description into Pluto's database
        # so it can respond if another gatway initiates
        # individual connection descriptions may override this
        auto=add

# description for opportunistic connections
conn me-to-anyone
        left=%defaultroute         # all connections should use default route
        right=%opportunistic       # anyone we can authenticate
        leftrsasigkey=%dnsondemand  # NEW: look up keys in DNS as-needed
        rightrsasigkey=%dnsondemand # (not at connection load time)
        rekey=no                   # let unused connections die
        keylife=1h                 # short
        auto=route                 # set up for opportunistic
        leftid=@xy.example.com     # our identity for IPSec negotiations
                                   # must match DNS and ipsec.secrets</PRE>

<P>Normally, you need to do only two things:</P>
<UL>
  <LI>edit <VAR>leftid=</VAR></LI>
  <LI>set <VAR>auto=route</VAR></LI>
</UL>
<P>
 However, some people may need to customize the <VAR>interfaces=</VAR> line
 in the "config setup" section. All other sections are identical for any
 standalone machine doing opportunistic encryption.</P>
<P>The @ sign in the <VAR>leftid=</VAR> makes the ID go "over the wire"
 as a Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).  Without it, an IP address would
 be used and this won't work.</P>
<P>The conn is not used to supply either public key. Your private key
 is in <A href="manpage.d/ipsec.secrets.5.html">ipsec.secrets(5)</A>
 and, for opportunistic encryption, the public keys for remote gateways
 are all looked up in DNS.</P>
<P>FreeS/WAN authenticates opportunistic encryption by <A href="#gen_rsa">RSA
 signature</A> only, so "public key" and "private key" refer to these keys.</P>
<P>While the <VAR>left</VAR> and <VAR>right</VAR> designations
 here are arbitrary, we follow a convention of using <VAR>left</VAR> for
 local and <VAR>right</VAR> for remote.</P>

<P><A href="quickstart.html#config.opp.client">Continue configuring
initiate-only opportunism.</A>

<H2><A name="qc.incoming.opp.conf">ipsec.conf for Incoming Opportunistic Encryption</A></H2>
Use the ipsec.conf above, except that the section describing opportunistic
connections is now:</P>
<PRE>
# description for opportunistic connections
conn me-to-anyone
        left=%defaultroute         # all connections should use default route
        right=%opportunistic       # anyone we can authenticate
        leftrsasigkey=%dnsondemand  # NEW: look up keys in DNS as-needed
        rightrsasigkey=%dnsondemand # (not at connection load time)
        rekey=no                   # let unused connections die
        keylife=1h                 # short
        auto=route                 # set up for opportunistic</PRE>

<P>Note that <VAR>leftid=</VAR> has been removed. With no explicit setting,
<VAR>leftid=</VAR> defaults to the IP of your public interface.</P>

<P><A href="quickstart.html#incoming.opp.conf">Continue configuring
full opportunism.</A>


<H2><A name="qc.gate.opp.conf">ipsec.conf for Opportunistic Gateway</A></H2>
Use the ipsec.conf above, plus these connections:

<PRE>conn subnet-to-anyone            # must be above me-to-anyone
       also=me-to-anyone
       leftsubnet=42.42.42.0/24

conn me-to-anyone                # just like for full opportunism
        left=%defaultroute
        right=%opportunistic
        leftrsasigkey=%dnsondemand
        rightrsasigkey=%dnsondemand
        keylife=1h
        rekey=no
        auto=route               # be sure this is enabled
                                 # Note there is NO leftid= </PRE>


<P>Note that a subnet described in ipsec.conf(5) need not correspond to a
 physical network segment. This is discussed in more detail in our
<A href="adv_config.html">advanced configuration</A> document.</P>

<P>If required, a gateway can easily provide this service for more than one
 subnet. You just add a connection description for each.</P>
