<A NAME="upgrading"></A><h1>Upgrading to FreeS/WAN 2.x</h1>


<H2>New! Built in Opportunistic connections</H2>

<P>Out of the box, FreeS/WAN 2.x will attempt to encrypt all your IP traffic.
It will try to establish IPsec connections for:</P>
<UL><LI>
IP traffic from the Linux box on which you have installed FreeS/WAN, and</LI>
<LI>
outbound IP traffic routed through that Linux box (eg. from a protected subnet).</LI>
</UL>
<P>FreeS/WAN 2.x uses <STRONG>hidden, automatically enabled 
 <VAR>ipsec.conf</VAR> connections</STRONG> to do this.</P>

<P>This behaviour is part of our campaign to get Opportunistic 
Encryption (OE) widespread in the Linux world, so that any two Linux boxes can
encrypt to one another without prearrangement.
There's one catch, however: you must <A HREF="quickstart.html#quickstart">set 
up a few DNS records</A> 
to distribute RSA public keys and (if applicable) IPsec gateway
information.</P>

<P>If you start FreeS/WAN before you have set up these DNS 
records, your connectivity will be slow, and 
messages relating to the built in connections will clutter your logs.
If you are unable to set up DNS for OE, you will wish to 
<A HREF="policygroups.html#disable_policygroups">disable the 
hidden connections</A>.</P>

<A NAME="upgrading.flagday"></A>

<H3>Upgrading Opportunistic Encryption
to 2.01 (or later)</H3>

<P>As of FreeS/WAN 2.01, Opportunistic Encryption (OE)
uses DNS TXT resource records (RRs) only (rather than TXT with KEY). 
This change causes a "flag day". 
Users of FreeS/WAN 2.00 (or earlier) OE who are upgrading may
need to post additional resource records.
</P>

<P>If you are running 
<A HREF="glossary.html#initiate-only">initiate-only OE</A>, 
you <em>must</em> put up a TXT record in any forward domain as per our 
<A HREF="quickstart.html#opp.client">quickstart instructions</A>. This
replaces your old forward KEY.
</P>

<P>
If you are running full OE, you require no updates. You already have 
the needed TXT record in the reverse domain. 
However, to facilitate future features, you
may also wish to publish that TXT record in a forward domain as 
instructed <A HREF="quickstart.html#opp.incoming">here</A>.
</P>

<P>If you are running OE on a gateway (and encrypting on behalf of subnetted
boxes) you require no updates. 
You already have the required TXT record in your gateway's reverse map,
and the TXT records for any subnetted boxes require no updating.
However, to facilitate future features, you may wish to publish your gateway's
 TXT record in a forward domain as shown 
<A HREF="quickstart.html#opp.incoming">here</A>.


<P>
During the transition, you may wish to leave any old KEY records up for
some time. They will provide limited backward compatibility. 
<!--
For more
detail on that compatibility, see <A HREF="oe.known-issues">Known Issues with
OE</A>.
-->
</P>

<H2>New! Policy Groups</H2>

<P>We want to make it easy for you to declare security policy as it
applies to IPsec connections.</P>

<P>Policy Groups make it simple to say:
</P>

<UL>
<LI>These are the folks I want to talk to in the clear.</LI>
<LI>These spammers' domains -- I don't want to talk to them at all.</LI>
<LI>To talk to the finance department, I must use IPsec.</LI>
<LI>For any other communication, try to encrypt, but it's okay if we can't.</LI></UL>

<P>FreeS/WAN then implements these policies, creating OE connections
if and when needed.
You can use Policy Groups along with connections you explicitly 
define in ipsec.conf.</P>

<P>For more information, see our
<A HREF="policygroups.html">Policy Group HOWTO</A>.</P>


<H2>New! Packetdefault Connection</H2>

<P>Free/SWAN 2.x ships with the <STRONG>automatically enabled, hidden
connection</STRONG> <VAR>packetdefault</VAR>. This configures
a FreeS/WAN box as an OE gateway for any hosts located
behind it. As mentioned above, you must configure some 
<A HREF="quickstart.html">DNS records</A> for 
OE to work.</P>
<P>As the name implies, this connection functions as a default. If you
have more specific connections, such as policy groups which configure 
your FreeS/WAN box as an OE gateway for a local subnet, these 
will apply before <VAR>packetdefault</VAR>. You can view 
<VAR>packetdefault</VAR>'s specifics in 
<A HREF="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html">man ipsec.conf</A>.
</P>


<H2>FreeS/WAN now disables Reverse Path Filtering</H2>

<P>FreeS/WAN often doesn't work with reverse path filtering. At
start time, FreeS/WAN now turns rp_filter off, and logs a warning.</P>

<P>FreeS/WAN does not turn it back on again. 
You can do this yourself with a command like:</P>

<PRE>   echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/conf/eth0/rp_filter</PRE>

<P>For eth0, substitute the interface which FreeS/WAN was affecting.</P>


<A NAME="ipsec.conf_v2"></A><H2>Revised <VAR>ipsec.conf</VAR></H2>

<H3>No promise of compatibility</H3>

<P>The FreeS/WAN team promised config-file compatibility throughout
the 1.x series. That means a 1.5 config file can be directly imported into
a fresh 1.99 install with no problems.</P>

<P>With FreeS/WAN 2.x, we've given ourselves permission to make the config
file easier to use. The cost: some FreeS/WAN 1.x configurations will not
work properly. Many of the new features are, however, backward compatible.</P>


<H3>Most <VAR>ipsec.conf</VAR> files will work fine</H3>

<P>... so long as you paste this line, <STRONG>with no preceding 
whitespace</STRONG>,
 at the top of your config file:
</P>

<PRE>    version 2</PRE>

<H3>Backward compatibility patch</H3>

<P>If the new defaults bite you, use 
<A HREF="ipsec.conf.2_to_1">
this <VAR>ipsec.conf</VAR> fragment</A> to simulate the old default values.</P>


<H3>Details</H3>

<P>
We've obsoleted various directives which almost no one was using:
</P>
<PRE>    dump
    plutobackgroundload
    no_eroute_pass
    lifetime
    rekeystart
    rekeytries</PRE>

<P>For most of these, there is some other way to elicit the desired behaviour.
See <A HREF="http://lists.freeswan.org/pipermail/design/2002-August/003243.html">
this post</A>.

<P>
We've made some settings, which almost everyone was using, defaults.
For example:
</P>

<PRE>    interfaces=%defaultroute
    plutoload=%search
    plutostart=%search
    uniqueids=yes</PRE>

<P>We've also changed some default values to help with OE and Policy Groups:</P>

<PRE>    authby=rsasig   ## not secret!!!
    leftrsasigkey=%dnsondemand ## looks up missing keys in DNS when needed.
    rightrsasigkey=%dnsondemand</PRE>

<P>
Of course, you can still override any defaults by explictly declaring something
else in your connection.
</P>

<A NAME="upgrading.rpms"></A><H3>Upgrading from 1.x RPMs to 2.x RPMs</H3>

<P>Note: When upgrading from 1-series to 2-series RPMs, 
<VAR>rpm -U</VAR> will not work.</P>

<P>You must instead erase the 1.x RPMs, then install the 2.x set:</P>
<PRE>    rpm -e freeswan</PRE>
<PRE>    rpm -e freeswan-module</PRE>

<P>On erasing, your old <VAR>ipsec.conf</VAR> should be moved to 
<VAR>ipsec.conf.rpmsave</VAR>.
Keep this. You will probably want to copy your existing connections to the 
end of your new 2.x file.</P>

<P>Install the RPMs suitable for your kernel version, such as:</P>
<PRE>    rpm -ivh freeswan-module-2.04_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm</PRE>
<PRE>    rpm -ivh freeswan-userland-2.04_2.4.20_20.9-0.i386.rpm</PRE>



<P>Or, to splice the files:</P>

<PRE>    cat /etc/ipsec.conf /etc/ipsec.conf.rpmsave > /etc/ipsec.conf.tmp
    mv /etc/ipsec.conf.tmp /etc/ipsec.conf</PRE>

<P>Then, remove the redundant <VAR>conn %default</VAR> and 
<VAR>config setup</VAR>
sections. Unless you have done any special configuring here, you'll likely
want to remove the 1.x versions. Remove <VAR>conn OEself</VAR>, if
present.</P>
