<h1><a name="kernelconfig">Kernel configuration for FreeS/WAN</a></h1>

<p>
This section lists many of the options available when configuring a Linux
  kernel, and explains how they should be set on a FreeS/WAN IPsec
  gateway.</p>

  <h2><a name="notall">Not everyone needs to worry about kernel configuration</a></h2>

  <p>Note that in many cases you do not need to mess with these.</p>

<p>
You may have a Linux distribution which comes with FreeS/WAN installed
(see this <a href="intro.html#products">list</a>).
  In that case, you need not do a FreeS/WAN installation or a kernel
  configuration. Of course, you might still want to configure and rebuild your
  kernel to improve performance or security. This can be done with standard
  tools described in the <a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel HowTo</a>.</p>

  <p>If you need to install FreeS/WAN, then you do need to configure a kernel.
  However, you may choose to do that using the simplest procedure:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Configure, build and test a kernel for your system before adding FreeS/WAN. See the <a
      href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel HowTo</a> for details. <strong>This step cannot be
      skipped</strong>. FreeS/WAN needs the results of your configuration.</li>
    <li>Then use FreeS/WAN's <var>make oldgo</var> command. This sets
      everything FreeS/WAN needs and retains your values everywhere else.</li>
  </ul>

<p>
This document is for those who choose to configure their FreeS/WAN kernel
themselves.</p>

<h2><a name="assume">Assumptions and notation</a></h2>

<p>
Help text for most kernel options is included with the kernel files, and
is accessible from within the configuration utilities. We assume
you will refer to that, and to the <a href="http://www.linuxdoc.org/HOWTO/Kernel-HOWTO.html">Kernel HowTo</a>, as
necessary. This document covers only the FreeS/WAN-specific aspects of the
problem.</p>

<p>
To avoid duplication, this document section does not cover settings for
the additional IPsec-related kernel options which become available after you
have patched your kernel with FreeS/WAN patches. There is help text for
those available from within the configuration utility.</p>

  <p>
We assume a common configuration in which the FreeS/WAN IPsec gateway is
also doing ipchains(8) firewalling for a local network, and possibly
masquerading as well.</p>

<p>
Some suggestions below are labelled as appropriate for "a true paranoid".
By this we mean they may cause inconvenience and it is not entirely clear
  they are necessary, but they appear to be the safest choice. Not using them
  might entail some risk. Of course one suggested mantra for security
  administrators is: "I know I'm paranoid. I wonder if I'm paranoid
  enough."</p>

  <h3><a name="labels">Labels used</a></h3>

<p>
Six labels are used to indicate how options should be set. We mark the
labels with [square brackets]. For two of these labels, you have no
choice:</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>[required]</dt>
      <dd>essential for FreeS/WAN operation.</dd>
    <dt>[incompatible]</dt>
      <dd>incompatible with FreeS/WAN.</dd>
  </dl>

  <p>those must be set correctly or FreeS/WAN will not work</p>

  <p>FreeS/WAN should work with any settings of the others, though of course
  not all combinations have been tested. We do label these in various ways,
  but <em>these labels are only suggestions</em>.</p>
  <dl>
    <dt>[recommended]</dt>
      <dd>useful on most FreeS/WAN gateways</dd>
    <dt>[disable]</dt>
      <dd>an unwelcome complication on a FreeS/WAN gateway.</dd>
    <dt>[optional]</dt>
      <dd>Your choice. We outline issues you might consider.</dd>
    <dt>[anything]</dt>
      <dd>This option has no direct effect on FreeS/WAN and related tools, so
        you should be able to set it as you please.</dd>
  </dl>

<p>
Of course complexity is an enemy in any effort to build secure systems.
<strong>For maximum security, any feature that can reasonably be turned off
should be</strong>. "If in doubt, leave it out."</p>
  
  <h2><a name="kernelopt">Kernel options for FreeS/WAN</a></h2>

<p>
Indentation is based on the nesting shown by 'make menuconfig' with a
2.2.16 kernel for the i386 architecture.</p>

            <dd>[optional] If this is <var>no</var>, experimental drivers are
              not shown in later menus.
              <p>For most FreeS/WAN work, <var>no</var> is the preferred
              setting. Using new or untested components is too risky for a
              security gateway.</p>
              <p>However, for some hardware (such as the author's network
              cards) the only drivers available are marked
              <var>new/experimental</var>. In such cases, you must enable this
              option or your cards will not appear under &quot;network device
              support&quot;. A true paranoid would leave this option off and
              replace the cards.</p>

      <dd>
      <dl>
          <dt>Enable loadable module support</dt>
            <dd>[optional] A true paranoid would disable this. An attacker who
              has root access to your machine can fairly easily install a
              bogus module that does awful things, provided modules are
              enabled. A common tool for attackers is a &quot;rootkit&quot;, a set
              of tools the attacker uses once he or she has become root on your system.
              The kit introduces assorted additional compromises so that the attacker
              will continue to &quot;own&quot; your system despite most things you might
              do to recovery the situation. For Linux, there is a tool called
              <a href="http://www.sans.org/newlook/resources/IDFAQ/knark.htm">knark</a>
              which is basically a rootkit packaged as a kernel module.
              <p>With modules disabled, an attacker cannot install a bogus module.
              The only way
              he can achieve the same effects is to install a new kernel and
              reboot. This is considerably more likely to be noticed.
              <p>Many FreeS/WAN gateways run with modules enabled. This
              simplifies some administrative tasks and some ipchains features
              are available only as modules. Once an enemy has root on your
              machine your security is nil, so arguably defenses which come
              into play only in that situation are pointless.</p>

          <dt>Kernel module loader</dt>
            <dd>[disable] It gives little benefit on a typical FreeS/WAN gate
              and entails some risk.</dd>

            <dd>[required]</dd>
          <dt>Sysctl interface</dt>
            <dd>[optional] If this option is turned on and the
              <var>/proc</var> filesystem installed, then you can control
              various system behaviours by writing to files under
              <var>/proc/sys</var>. For example:
              <pre>        echo 1 &gt; /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ipforward</pre>
              turns IP forwarding on.
              <p>Disabling this option breaks many firewall scripts. A true
              paranoid would disable it anyway since it might conceivably be
              of use to an attacker.</p>

            <dd>[optional] This kernel feature supports tools such as
              tcpdump(8) which communicate directly with network hardware,
              bypassing kernel protocols. This is very much a two-edged sword:
              <ul>
                <li>such tools can be very useful to the firewall admin,
                  especially during initial testing</li>
                <li>should an evildoer breach your firewall, such tools could
                  give him or her a great deal of information about the rest
                  of your network</li>
              </ul>
              We recommend disabling this option on production gateways.</dd>

          <dt>Network firewalls</dt>
            <dd>[recommended] You need this if the IPsec gateway also
              functions as a firewall.
              <p>Even if the IPsec gateway is not your primary firewall, we
              suggest setting this so that you can protect the gateway with at
              least basic local packet filters.</p>
            </dd>
          <dt>Socket filtering</dt>
            <dd>[disable] This enables an older filtering interface. We suggest
                using ipchains(8) instead. To do that, set the &quot;Network
                firewalls&quot; option just above, and not this one.</dd>

                    people have used to good advantage in their scripts for
                    FreeS/WAN gateway management. It is not used in our
                    distributed scripts, so not required unless you want it
                    for custom scripts. It requires the <a

          <dt>IPv6</dt>
            <dd>[optional] FreeS/WAN does not currently support IPv6, though work on
              integrating FreeS/WAN with the Linux IPv6 stack has begun.
              <a href="compat.html#ipv6">Details</a>.
              <p>
              It should be possible to use IPv4 FreeS/WAN on a machine which also
              does IPv6. This combination is not yet well tested. We would be quite
              interested in hearing results from anyone expermenting with it, via the
              <a href="mail.html">mailing list</a>.
              <p>
              We do not recommend using IPv6 on production FreeS/WAN gateways until
              more testing has been done.

            <dd>[disable]</dd>
          <dt>Appletalk</dt>
            <dd>[disable] Quite a few Linux installations use IP but also have
              some other protocol, such as Appletalk or IPX, for communication
              with local desktop machines. In theory it should be possible to
              configure IPsec for the IP side of things without interfering
              with the second protocol.
              <p>We do not recommend this. Keep the software on your gateway
              as simple as possible. If you need a Linux-based Appletalk or
              IPX server, use a separate machine.</p>

      <dd>[anything] should work, but there are some points to note.
        <p>The development team test almost entirely on 10 or 100 megabit
        Ethernet and modems. In principle, any device that can do IP should be
        just fine for IPsec, but in the real world any device that has not
        been well-tested is somewhat risky. By all means try it, but don't bet
        your project on it until you have solid test results.</p>
        <p>If you disabled experimental drivers in the <a
        href="#maturity">Code maturity</a> section above, then those drivers
        will not be shown here. Check that option before going off to hunt for
        missing drivers.</p>
        <p>If you want Linux to automatically find more than one ethernet
        interface at boot time, you need to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>compile the appropriate driver(s) into your kernel. Modules will
            not work for this</li>
          <li>add a line such as
<pre>
   append="ether=0,0,eth0 ether=0,0,eth1"
</pre>
            to your /etc/lilo.conf file. In some cases you may need to specify
            parameters such as IRQ or base address. The example uses &quot;0,0&quot;
            for these, which tells the system to search. If the search does not
            succeed on your hardware, then you should retry with explicit parameters.
            See the lilo.conf(5) man page for details.</li>
          <li>run lilo(8)</li>
        </ul>
        Having Linux find the cards this way is not necessary, but is usually more
        convenient than loading modules in your boot scripts.</dd>
