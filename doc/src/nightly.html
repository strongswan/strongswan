<h1><a name="nightly">Nightly regression testing</a></h1>

<p>
The nightly regression testing system consists of several shell scripts
and some perl scripts. The goal is to check out a fresh tree, run "make check" on it,
record the results and summarize the results to the team and to the web site.
</p>

<P>
Output can be found on <A HREF="http://bugs.freeswan.org:81/">adams</A>,
although the tests are actually run on another project machine.</P>

<H1><A name="nightlyhowto">How to setup the nightly build</A></h1>

<P>
The best way to do nightly testing is to setup a new account. We call the
account "build" - you could call it something else, but there may
still be some references to ~build in the scripts.
</P>

<H2> Files you need to know about </H2>
<P>
As few files as possible need to be extracted from the source tree -
files are run from the source tree whenever possible. However, there
are some bootstrap and configuration files that are necessary.
</P>

<P>
There are 7 files in testing/utils that are involved:
<DL>
<DT> nightly-sample.sh </DT>
<DD> This is the root of the build process. This file should be copied out
of the CVS tree, to $HOME/bin/nightly.sh of the build account. This
file should be invoked from cron. </DD>
<DT> freeswan-regress-env-sample.sh </DT>
<DD> This file should be copied to $HOME/freeswan-regress-env.sh. It
  should be edited to localize the values. See below.</DD>
<DT> regress-cleanup.pl </DT>
<DD> This file needs to be copied to $HOME/bin/regress-cleanup.pl. It
  is invoked by the nightly file before doing anything else. It
  removes previous nights builds in order to free up disk space for
  the build about to be done.</DD>
<DT> teammail-sample.sh </DT>
<DD> A script used to send results email to the "team". This sample
  script could be copied to $HOME/bin/teammail.sh. This version will
  PGP encrypt all the output to the team members. If this script is used,
  then PGP will have to be properly setup to have the right keys.</DD>
<DT> regress-nightly.sh </DT>
<DD> This is the first stage of the nightly build. This stage will
  call other scripts as appropriate, and will extract the source code
  from CVS. This script should be copied to $HOME/bin/regress-nightly.sh</DD>
<DT> regress-stage2.sh </DT>
<DD> This is the second stage of the nightly build. It is called in
  place. It essentially sets up the UML setup in umlsetup.sh, and
  calls "make check".</DD>
<DT> regress-summarize-results.pl
<DD> This script will summarize the results from the tests to a
  permanent directory set by $REGRESSRESULTS. It is invoked from the
  stage2 nightly script.
<DT> regress-chart.sh </DT>
<DD> This script is called at the end of the build process, and will
  summarize each night's results (as saved into $REGRESSRESULTS by
  regress-summarize-results.pl) as a chart using gnuplot. Note that
  this requires at least gnuplot 3.7.2.</DD>
</DL>

<H2>Configuring freeswan-regress-env.sh</H2>

<P>For more info on KERNPOOL, UMLPATCH, BASICROOT and SHAREDIR, see
  <A HREF="umltesting.html">User-Mode-Linux testing guide</A>.
</P>

<DL>
<DT> KERNPOOL </DT>
<DD> Extract copy of some kernel source to be used for UML builds</DD>
<DT> UMLPATCH </DT>
<DD> matching User-Mode-Linux patch.</DD>
<DT> BASICROOT</DT>
<DD> the root file system image (see
  <A HREF="umltesting.html">User-Mode-Linux testing guide</A>).</DD>
<DT> SHAREDIR=${BASICROOT}/usr/share</DT>
<DD> The /usr/share to use.</DD>
<DT> REGRESSTREE</DT>
<DD> A directory in which to store the nightly regression
  results. Directories will be created by date in this tree.</DD>

<DT> TCPDUMP=tcpdump-3.7.1</DT>
<DD> The path to the <A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/">tcpdump</A>
  to use. This must have crypto compiled in, and must be at least 3.7.1</DT>

<DT> KERNEL_RH7_2_SRC=/a3/kernel_sources/linux-2.4.9-13/</DT>
<DD> An extracted copy of the RedHat 7.2. kernel source. If set, then
  the packaging/rpm-rh72-install-01 test will be run, and an RPM will
  be built as a test.</DD>
  
<DT> KERNEL_RH7_3_SRC=/a3/kernel_sources/rh/linux-2.4.18-5</DT>
<DD> An extracted copy of the RedHat 7.3. kernel source. If set, then
  the packaging/rpm-rh73-install-01 test will be run, and an RPM will
  be built as a test.</DD>
  
<DT> NIGHTLY_WATCHERS="userid,userid,userid"</DT>
<DD> The list of people who should receive nightly output. This is
  used by teammail.sh</DD>

<DT> FAILLINES=128</DT>
<DD> How many lines of failed test output to include in the nightly
  output</DD>

<DT> PATH=$PATH:/sandel/bin export PATH</DT>
<DD> You can also override the path if necessary here.</DD>

<DT> CVSROOT=:pserver:anoncvs@ip212.xs4net.freeswan.org:/freeswan/MASTER</DT>
<DD> The CVSROOT to use. This example may work for anonymous CVS, but
  will be 12 hours behind the primary, and is still experimental</DD>

<DT> SNAPSHOTSIGDIR=$HOME/snapshot-sig</DT>
<DD> For the release tools, where to put the generated per-snapshot
  signature keys</DD>

<DT> LASTREL=1.97</DT>
<DD> the name of the last release branch (to find the right
  per-snapshot signature</DT>

<DD>
