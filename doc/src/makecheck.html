<h1><a name="makecheck">How to configure to use "make check"</a></h1>

<H2>What is "make check"</H2>
<p>
"make check" is a target in the top level makefile. It takes care of
running a number of unit and system tests to confirm that FreeSWAN has 
been compiled correctly, and that no new bugs have been introduced.
</p>
<p>
As FreeSWAN contains both kernel and userspace components, doing testing
of FreeSWAN requires that the kernel be simulated. This is typically difficult
to do as a kernel requires that it be run on bare hardware. A technology
has emerged that makes this simpler. This is
<A HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net">User Mode Linux</A>. 
</p>

<p>
User-Mode Linux is a way to build a Linux kernel such that it can run as a process
under another Linux (or in the future other) kernel. Presently, this can only be
done for 2.4 guest kernels. The host kernel can be 2.2 or 2.4. 
</p>

<p>
"make check" expects to be able to build User-Mode Linux kernels with FreeSWAN included. 
To do this it needs to have some files downloaded and extracted prior
to running "make check". This is described in the
<A HREF="umltesting.html">UML testing</A> document.  
</p>

<p>
After having run the example in the UML testing document and
successfully brought up the four machine combination, you are ready to 
use "make check"
</p>

<h2>Running "make check"</h2>
<p>
"make check" works by walking the FreeSWAN source tree invoking the
"check" target at each node. At present there are tests defined only
for the <CODE>klips</CODE> directory. These tests will use the UML
infrastructure to test out pieces of the <CODE>klips</CODE> code.
</p>
<p>
The results of the tests can be recorded. If the environment variable
<CODE>$REGRESSRESULTS</CODE> is non-null, then the results of each
test will be recorded. This can be used as part of a nightly
regression testing system, see
<A HREF="nightly.html">Nightly testing</A> for more details.
</p>
<p>
"make check" otherwise prints a minimal amount of output for each
test, and indicates pass/fail status of each test as they are run.
Failed tests do not cause failure of the target in the form of exit
codes. 
</p>

<H1>How to write a "make check" test</H1>

<h2>Structure of a test</h2>

<p>
Each test consists of a set of directories under <CODE>testing/</CODE>.
There are directories for <CODE>klips</CODE>, <CODE>pluto</CODE>, <CODE>packaging</CODE>
and <CODE>libraries</CODE>.
Each directory has a list of tests to run is stored in a file called <CODE>TESTLIST</CODE> in that directory. e.g. <CODE>testing/klips/TESTLIST</CODE>.
</P>

<H2 NAME="TESTLIST">The TESTLIST</H2>
<P>
This isn't actually a shell script. It just looks like one. Some tools other than
/bin/sh process it. Lines that start with # are comments. </P>

<PRE>
# test-kind     directory-containing-test       expectation     [PR#]
</PRE>

<P>The first word provides the test type, detailed below. </P>
<P> The second word is the name of the test to run. This the directory
in which the test case is to be found..</P>
<P>The third word may be one of: 
<DL>
<DT> blank/good</DT>
<DD>the test is believed to function, report failure</DD>
<DT> bad</DT>
<DD> the test is known to fail, report unexpected success</DD>
<DT> suspended</DT>
<DD> the test should not be run</DD>
</DL>

<P>
The fourth word may be a number, which is a PR# if the test is
failing.
</P>

<H2>Test kinds</H2>
The test types are:

<DL>
<DT>skiptest</DT>
<DD>means run no test.</DD>
<DT>ctltest</DT>
<DD>means run a single system without input/output.</DD>
<DT>klipstest</DT>
<DD>means run a single system with input/output networks</DD>
<DT><A HREF="#umlplutotest">umlplutotest</A></DT>
<DD>means run a pair of systems</DD>
<DT><A HREF="#umlXhost">umlXhost</A></DT>
<DD>run an arbitrary number of systems</DT>
<DT>suntest (TBD)</DT>
<DD>means run a quad of east/west/sunrise/sunset</DD>
<DT>roadtest (TBD)</DT>
<DD>means run a trio of east-sunrise + warrior</DD>
<DT>extrudedtest (TBD)</DT>
<DD>means run a quad of east-sunrise + warriorsouth + park</DD>
<DT>mkinsttest</TD>
<DD>a test of the "make install" machinery.</DD>
<DT>kernel_test_patch</TD>
<DD>a test of the "make kernelpatch" machinery.</DD>
</DL>

Tests marked (TBD) have yet to be fully defined.
</p>

<p>
Each test directory has a file in it called <CODE>testparams.sh</CODE>.
This file sets a number of environment variables to define the
parameters of the test.
</p>

<H2>Common parameters</H2>
<DL>
<DT>TESTNAME</DT>
<DD>the name of the test (repeated for checking purposes)</DD>

<DT>TEST_TYPE</DT>
<DD>the type of the test (repeat of type type above)</DD>

<DT>TESTHOST</DT>
<DD>the name of the UML machine to run for the test, typically "east"
  or "west"</DD>

<DT>TEST_PURPOSE</DT>
<DD>The purpose of the test is one of: 

<DL>
<DT>goal</DT>
<DD>The goal purpose is where a test is defined for code that is not yet
finished. The test indicates when the goals have in fact been reached.</DD>
<DT>regress</DT>
<DD>This is a test to determine that a previously existing bug has been repaired. This 
test will initially be created to reproduce the bug in isolation, and then the bug will 
be fixed.</DD> 
<DT>exploit</DT>
<DD>This is a set of packets/programs that causes a vulnerability to be
exposed. It is a specific variation of the regress option.</DD>
</DL>
</DD>

<DT>TEST_GOAL_ITEM<DT>
<DD>in the case of a goal test, this is a reference to the requirements document</DD>

<DT>TEST_PROB_REPORT</DT>
<DD>in the case of regression test, this the problem report number from GNATS</DD>

<DT>TEST_EXPLOIT_URL</DT>
<DD>in the case of an exploit, this is a URL referencing the paper explaining 
the origin of the test and the origin of exploit software</DD>

<DT>REF_CONSOLE_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>a file in the test directory that contains the sanitized console
  output against which to compare the output of the actual test.</DD>
<DT>REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS</DT>
<DD>a list of scripts (found in <CODE>klips/test/fixups</CODE>) to
  apply to sanitize the console output of the machine under test.
  These are typically perl, awk or sed scripts that remove things in
  the kernel output that change each time the test is run and/or
  compiled.
</DD>
<DT>INIT_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD><p>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console
  in single user mode prior to starting the tests. This file will
  usually set up any eroute's and SADB entries that are required for
  the test. </p>
<p>Lines beginning with # are skipped. Blank lines are
  skipped. Otherwise, a shell prompted is waited for each time
  (consisting of <CODE>\n#</CODE>) and then the command is sent.
  Note that the prompt is waited for before the command and not after, 
  so completion of the last command in the script is not
  required. This is often used to invoke a program to monitor the
  system, e.g. <CODE>ipsec pf_key</CODE>.
</P>
<DT>RUN_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD><P>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console
      in single user mode, before the packets are sent. On single machine
      tests, this script doesn't provide any more power than INIT_SCRIPT,
      but is implemented for consistency's sake.</P>
<DT>FINAL_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD><p>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console
  in single user mode after the final packet is sent. Similar to INIT_SCRIPT,
  above. If not specified, then the single command "halt" is sent.
  If specified, then the script should end with a halt command to
  nicely shutdown the UML.
</P>
<DT>CONSOLEDIFFDEBUG</DT>
<DD>If set to "true" then the series of console fixups (see REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS) will be output after it is constructed. (It should be set to "false", or unset otherwise)</DD>
<DT>NETJIGDEBUG</DT>
<DD>If set to "true" then the series of console fixups (see REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS) will be output after it is constructed. (It should be set to "false", or unset otherwise)</DD>
<DT>NETJIGTESTDEBUG</DT>
<DD> If set to "netjig", then the results of talking to the <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE>
will be printed to stderr during the test. In addition, the jig will
be invoked with --debug, which causes it to log its process ID, and
wait 60 seconds before continuing. This can be used if you are trying
to debug the <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE> program itself.</DT>
<DT>HOSTTESTDEBUG</DT>
<DD> If set to "hosttest", then the results of taling to the consoles of the UMLs will
be printed to stderr during the test.</DT>
<DT>NETJIGWAITUSER</DT>
<DD> If set to "waituser", then the scripts will wait forever for user
  input before they shut the tests down. Use this is if you are
  debugging through the kernel.</DD>

<DT>PACKETRATE</DT>
<DD> A number, in miliseconds (default is 500ms) at which packets will
  be replayed by the netjig.</DD>
</DL>


<H2>KLIPStest paramaters</H2>
<P>
The klipstest function starts a program
(<CODE>testing/utils/uml_netjig/uml_netjig</CODE>) to
setup a bunch of I/O sockets (that simulate network interfaces). It
then exports the references to these sockets to the environment and
invokes (using system()) a given script. It waits for the script to
finish.
</P>

<!-- <IMG SRC="single_netjig.png" ALT="block diagram of uml_netjig"> -->

<P>
The script invoked (<CODE>testing/utils/host-test.tcl</CODE>) is a TCL
<A HREF="http://expect.nist.gov/">expect</A> script that arranges to start the UML 
and configure it appropriately for the test. The configuration is done 
with the script given above for <VAR>INIT_SCRIPT</VAR>. The TCL script then forks,
leaves the UML in the background and exits. uml_netjig continues. It then
starts listening to the simulated network answering ARPs and inserting
packets as appropriate.
</P>

<P>
The klipstest function invokes <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE> with arguments
to capture output from network interface(s) and insert packets as
appropriate:
<DL>
<DT>PUB_INPUT</DT>
<DD>a <A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/">pcap</A> file to feed in on
  the public (encrypted) interface. (typically, eth1)</DD>
<DT>PRIV_INPUT</DT>
<DD>a pcap file to feed in on the private (plain-text) interface
  (typically, eth0).</DD>
<DT>REF_PUB_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the public
  (eth1) interface are captured to a
  <A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/">pcap</A> file by
  <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE>. The klipstest function then uses tcpdump on 
  the file to produce text output, which is compared to the file given.</DD>
<DT>REF_PUB_FILTER</DT>
<DD>a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further processing. Defaults to "cat".</DD>
<DT>REF_PRIV_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the private
  (eth0) interface are captured and compared after conversion by
  tcpdump, as with <VAR>REFPUBOUTPUT</VAR>.</DD>
<DT>REF_PRIV_FILTER</DT>
<DD>a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further processing. Defaults to "cat".</DD>
<DT>EXITONEMPTY</DT>
<DD>a flag for <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE>. It should contain
  "--exitonempty" of uml_netjig should exit when all of the input
  (<VAR>PUBINPUT</VAR>,<VAR>PRIVINPUT</VAR>) packets have been injected.</DD>
<DT>ARPREPLY</DT>
<DD>a flag for <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE>. It should contain "--arpreply" 
  if <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE> should reply to ARP requests. One will
  typically set this to avoid having to fudge the ARP cache manually.</DD>
<DT>TCPDUMPFLAGS</DT>
<DD>a set of flags for the tcpdump used when converting captured
  output. Typical values will include "-n" to turn off DNS, and often
  "-E" to set the decryption key (tcpdump 3.7.1 and higher only) for
  ESP packets. The "-t" flag (turn off timestamps) is provided automatically</DD>

<DT>NETJIG_EXTRA</DT>
<DD>additional comments to be sent to the netjig. This may arrange to
  record or create additional networks, or may toggle options.
</DL>

<H2>mkinsttest paramaters</H2>
<P>
The basic concept of the <CODE>mkinsttest</CODE> test type is that it 
performs a "make install" to a temporary $DESTDIR. The resulting tree can then
be examined to determine if it was done properly. The files can be uninstalled
to determine if the file list was correct, or the contents of files can be
examined more precisely.
</P>

<DL>
<DT>INSTALL_FLAGS</DT>
<DD>If set, then an install will be done. This provides the set of flags to 
provide for the install. The target to be used (usually "install") must be 
among the flags. </DD>  
<DT>POSTINSTALL_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD>If set, a script to run after initial "make install". Two arguments are provided: an absolute path to the root of the FreeSWAN src tree, and an absolute path to the temporary installation area.</DD>
<DT>INSTALL2_FLAGS</DT>
<DD>If set, a second install will be done using these flags. Similarly to
INSTALL_FLAGS, the target must be among the flags. </DD>
<DT>UNINSTALL_FLAGS</DT>
<DD>If set, an uninstall will be done using these flags. Similarly to
INSTALL_FLAGS, the target (usually "uninstall") must be among the flags.</DD> 
<DT>REF_FIND_f_l_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>If set, a <CODE>find $ROOT ( -type f -or -type -l )</CODE> will be done to get a list of a real files and symlinks. The resulting file will be compared
to the file listed by this option.</DD>
<DT>REF_FILE_CONTENTS</DT>
<DD>If set, it should point to a file containing records for the form:
<PRE>
  <VARIABLE>reffile</VARIABLE>   <VARIABLE>samplefile</VARIABLE>
</PRE>
one record per line. A diff between the provided reference file, and the
sample file (located in the temporary installation root) will be done for
each record.
</DD>
</DL>

<H2>rpm_build_install_test paramaters</H2>
<P>
The <CODE>rpm_build_install_test</CODE> type is to verify that the proper
packing list is produced by "make rpm", and that the mechanisms for
building the kernel modules produce consistent results.
</P>

<DL>
<DT>RPM_KERNEL_SOURCE</DT>
<DD>Point to an extracted copy of the RedHat kernel source code. Variables
from the environment may be used.</DD>  
<DT>REF_RPM_CONTENTS</DT>
<DD>This is a file containing one record per line. Each record consists
of a RPM name (may contain wildcards) and a filename to compare the
contents to. The RPM will be located and a file list will be produced with
rpm2cpio.</DD>
</DL>

<H2>libtest paramaters</H2>
<P>
The libtest test is for testing library routines. The library file is
expected to provided an <CODE>#ifdef</CODE> by the name of
<VAR>library</VAR><CODE_MAIN</CODE>. 
The libtest type invokes the C compiler to compile this file, links it against
<CODE>libfreeswan.a</CODE> (to resolve any other dependancies) and runs the
test with the <CODE>-r</CODE> argument to invoke a regression test.</P>
<P>The library test case is expected to do a self-test, exiting with status code 0 if everything is okay, and with non-zero otherwise. A core dump (exit code greater than 128) is noted specifically.
</P>
<P>
Unlike other tests, there are no subdirectories required, or other
parameters to set.  
</P>

<H2 NAME="umlplutotest">umlplutotest paramaters</H2>
<P>
The umlplutotest function starts a pair of user mode line processes.
This is a 2-host version of umlXhost. The "EAST" and "WEST" slots are defined.
</P>

<H2 NAME="umlXhost">umlXhost parameters</H2>
<P>
The umlXtest function starts an arbitrary number of user mode line processes.
</P>

<!-- <IMG SRC="single_netjig.png" ALT="block diagram of uml_netjig"> -->

<P>
The script invoked (<CODE>testing/utils/Xhost-test.tcl</CODE>) is a TCL
<A HREF="http://expect.nist.gov/">expect</A> script that arranges to start each
UML   
and configure it appropriately for the test. It then starts listening
(using uml_netjig) to the simulated network answering ARPs and
inserting packets as appropriate.  
</P>

<P>
umlXtest has a series of slots, each of which should be filled by a host.
The list of slots is controlled by the variable, XHOST_LIST. This variable
should be set to a space seperated list of slots. The former umlplutotest
is now implemented as a variation of the umlXhost test,
with XHOST_LIST="EAST WEST".
</P>

<P>
For each host slot that is defined, a series of variables should be
filled in, defining what configuration scripts to use for that host.
</P>

<P>
The following are used to control the console input and output to the system.
Where the string ${host} is present, the host slot should be filled in.
I.e. for the two host system with XHOST_LIST="EAST WEST", then the
variables: EAST_INIT_SCRIPT and WEST_INIT_SCRIPT will exist.
<DL>
<DT>${host}HOST</DT>
<DD>The name of the UML host which will fill this slot</DD>
<DT>${host}_INIT_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD><p>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console
  in single user mode prior to starting the tests. This file will
  usually set up any eroute's and SADB entries that are required for
  the test. Similar to INIT_SCRIPT, above.</p>
<DT>${host}_RUN_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD><P>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console
      in single user mode, before the packets are sent. This set of 
      commands is run after all of the virtual machines are initialized.
      I.e. after EAST_INIT_SCRIPT <B>AND</B> WEST_INIT_SCRIPT. This script
      can therefore do things that require that all machines are properly
      configured.</P>
<DT>${host}_RUN2_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD><P>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console
      in single user mode, after the packets are sent. This set of 
      commands is run before any of the virtual machines have been shut
      down. (I.e. before EAST_FINAL_SCRIPT <B>AND</B> WEST_FINAL_SCRIPT.)
      This script can therefore catch post-activity status reports.</P>
<DT>${host}_FINAL_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD><p>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console
  in single user mode after the final packet is sent. Similar to INIT_SCRIPT,
  above. If not specified, then the single command "halt" is sent. Note that
  when this script is run, the other virtual machines may already have been killed.
  If specified, then the script should end with a halt command to nicely
  shutdown the UML. 
</P>
<DT>REF_${host}_CONSOLE_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>Similar to REF_CONSOLE_OUTPUT, above.</DT>
</DL>
</P>

<P>Some additional flags apply to all hosts:
<DL>
<DT>REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS</DT>
<DD>a list of scripts (found in <CODE>klips/test/fixups</CODE>) to
  apply to sanitize the console output of the machine under test.
  These are typically perl, awk or sed scripts that remove things in
  the kernel output that change each time the test is run and/or
  compiled.
</DD>
</DL>
</P>

<P> In addition to input to the console, the networks may have input
fed to them:
<DL>
<DT>EAST_INPUT/WEST_INPUT</DT>
<DD>a <A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/">pcap</A> file to feed in on
  the private network side of each network. The "EAST" and "WEST" here 
refer to the networks, not the hosts.</DD>
<DT>REF_PUB_FILTER</DT>
<DD>a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further processing. Defaults to "cat".</DD>
<DT>REF_EAST_FILTER/REF_WEST_FILTER</DT>
<DD>a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further processing. Defaults to "cat".</DD><
<DT>TCPDUMPFLAGS</DT>
<DD>a set of flags for the tcpdump used when converting captured
  output. Typical values will include "-n" to turn off DNS, and often
  "-E" to set the decryption key (tcpdump 3.7.1 and higher only) for
  ESP packets. The "-t" flag (turn off timestamps) is provided automatically</DD>
<DT>REF_EAST_OUTPUT/REF_WEST_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the private
  (eth0) interface are captured and compared after conversion by
  tcpdump, as with <VAR>REF_PUB_OUTPUT</VAR>.</DD>
</P>

<P>
There are two additional environment variables that may be set on the
command line:
<DL>
<DT> NETJIGVERBOSE=verbose export NETJIGVERBOSE</DT>
<DD> If set, then the test output will be "chatty", and let you know what
  commands it is running, and as packets are sent. Without it set, the
  output is limited to success/failure messages.</DD>
<DT> NETJIGTESTDEBUG=netjig export NETJIGTESTDEBUG</DT>
<DD> This will enable debugging of the communication with uml_netjig,
  and turn on debugging in this utility.
  This does not imply NETJIGVERBOSE.</DL>
<DT> HOSTTESTDEBUG=hosttest export HOSTTESTDEBUG</DT>
<DD> This will show all interactions with the user-mode-linux
  consoles</DD>
</DL>
</P>

<H2 NAME="kernelpatch">kernel_patch_test paramaters</H2>
<P>
The kernel_patch_test function takes some kernel source, copies it with
lndir, and then applies the patch as produced by "make kernelpatch".
</P>
<P>
The following are used to control the input and output to the system:
<DL>
<DT>KERNEL_NAME</DT>
<DD>the kernel name, typically something like "linus" or "rh"</DD>
<DT>KERNEL_VERSION</DT>
<DD>the kernel version number, as in "2.2" or "2.4".</DD>
<DT>KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC</DT>

<H2 NAME="modtest">module_compile paramaters</H2>
<P>
The module_compile test attempts to build the KLIPS module against a
given set of kernel source. This is also done by the RPM tests, but
in a very specific manner.
</P>
<P>
There are two variations of this test - one where the kernel either
doesn't need to be configured, or is already done, and tests were there
is a local configuration file.
</P>
<P>
Where the kernel doesn't need to be configured, the kernel source that
is found is simply used. It may be a RedHat-style kernel, where one
can cause it to configure itself via rhconfig.h-style definitions. Or,
it may just be a kernel tree that has been configured. 
</P>
<P>
If the variable KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE is set, then a new directory is
created for the kernel source. It is populated with lndir(1). The referenced
file is then copied in as .config, and "make oldconfig" is used to configure
the kernel. This resulting kernel is then used as the reference source.
</P>
<p>
In all cases, the kernel source is found the same was for the kernelpatch
test, i.e. via KERNEL_VERSION/KERNEL_NAME and KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC.</P>
<P>
Once there is kernel source, the module is compiled using the top-level
"make module" target. 
</P>
<P>
The test is considered successful if an executable is found in OUTPUT/module/ipsec.o at the end of the test.
</P>

<DT> "tcpdump dissector" not available. </DT>
<DD> This is a non-fatal warning. If uml_netjig is invoked with the -t 
  option, then it will attempt to use tcpdump's dissector to decode
  each packet that it processes. The dissector is presently not
  available, so this option it normally turned off at compile time.
  The dissector library will be released with tcpdump version
  4.0.</DD>
