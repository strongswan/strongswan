<P>
This document provides general instructions on how to cross compile 
FreeS/WAN, 
that is - compile it for another architecture (eg: StrongARM)</P>

<H2><A NAME="setup"></A>Setting up your Environment</H2>
<H3>Enviroment Variables</H3>
<P>There are a number of environment variables you can set to help facilitate
cross compiling FreeS/WAN.  All examples will are using the bash shell. 
</P>
<P>The following is an example of the how to set the environment variables if
you were cross compiling using the Embedix ARM toolchain, to build for an embedded
device like the Sharp Zaurus.  Set these while you are in the FreeS/WAN directory.
It is often simpler to put the entire list into a script (eg: cross-setup.sh), and 
then "source cross-setup.sh" or similar.
<pre>
export ARCH=arm
export CC=/opt/Embedix/tools/bin/arm-linux-gcc
export LD=/opt/Embedix/tools/bin/arm-linux-ld
export RANLIB=/opt/Embedix/tools/bin/arm-linux-ranlib 
export AR=/opt/Embedix/tools/bin/arm-linux-ar 
export AS=/opt/Embedix/tools/bin/arm-linux-as 
export STRIP=/opt/Embedix/tools/bin/arm-linux-strip 
export KERNELSRC=/zaurus/kernel-2.4.6
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/Embedix/tools/lib/gcc-lib/arm-linux/2.95.2/
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/Embedix/tools/bin
export DESTDIR=/zaurus/binaries
</pre>
In the example above, we setup all of the usual gcc + bin-utils programs, 
as well as setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to our cross-compiled system libraries, 
and DESTDIR to our output directory.
</P>

<H3>Kernel Source</H3>
<P>Place a copy of the kernel source, setup for your target device somewhere on
your filesystem and set KERNELSRC= to this directory.  You will need to prepare 
your kernel source treefirst, by running "make menuconfig && make dep && make 
modules".  Once this is done, you can move on to building FreeS/WAN</P>

<H2><A NAME="building"></A>Building</H2>
<H3>The Make Process</H3>
<P>There are two parts to building FreeS/WAN - the userland programs and utilities, 
and the ipsec.o kernel module.  Each can be built seperatly, making debugging the
build process simpler.
</P>
<P>Step 1 is to run "make programs".  This will build the required libs 
(libfreeswan.a) as well as all of the userland tools (pluto, whack, etc...).  
Provided your environment variables are set correctly, you should see the output
using your specified gcc (arm-linux-gcc for our example), ld, as, ar and 
ranlib.</P>
<P>If this completes successfully, you can run "make install" to install a copy of
all of the binaries, man pages and other documentation to DESTDIR.</P>
<P>Step 2 is to build the ipsec.o module.  This is done with "make oldmod", which
should change into the KERNELSRC directory and then compile and link the required
files to generate an ipsec.o file.  If this is successful, you will end up with an
ipsec.o file in your FreeS/WAN directory, under linux/net/ipsec/.</P>
<P>Remember to install this to /lib/modules/$kernelversion/kernel/net/ipsec/ on 
your target machine.</P>



<H2><A NAME="common"></A>Common Problems Building</H2>
<P>Here is a list of common problems/errors you may run into when cross compiling
FreeS/WAN.</P>
<UL>
<LI>gmp.h, libgmp not found, error with -lgmp.  All of these refer to the GNU Math 
Precision Library.  You will need to have already built this for your target 
system.  Place libgmp.so in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, and ensure the headers are in your
include path as well.
