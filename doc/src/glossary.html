<p>Entries are in alphabetical order. Some entries are only one line or one
paragraph long. Others run to several paragraphs. I have tried to put the
essential information in the first paragraph so you can skip the other
paragraphs if that seems appropriate.</p>

  <dt><a name="3DES">3DES (Triple DES)</a></dt>
    <dd>Using three <a href="#DES">DES</a> encryptions on a single data
      block, with at least two different keys, to get higher security than is
      available from a single DES pass. The three-key version of 3DES is the
      default encryption algorithm for <a href="#FreeSWAN">Linux
      FreeS/WAN</a>.
      <p><a href="#IPSEC">IPsec</a> always does 3DES with three different
      keys, as required by RFC 2451. For an explanation of the two-key
      variant, see <a href="#2key">two key triple DES</a>. Both use an <a
      href="#EDE">EDE</a> encrypt-decrypt-encrpyt sequence of operations.</p>
      <p>Single <a href="#DES">DES</a> is <a
      href="politics.html#desnotsecure">insecure</a>.</p>
      <p>Double DES is ineffective. Using two 56-bit keys, one might expect
      an attacker to have to do 2<sup>112</sup> work to break it. In fact,
      only 2<sup>57</sup> work is required with a <a
      href="#meet">meet-in-the-middle attack</a>, though a large amount of
      memory is also required. Triple DES is vulnerable to a similar attack,
      but that just reduces the work factor from the 2<sup>168</sup> one
      might expect to 2<sup>112</sup>. That provides adequate protection
      against <a href="#brute">brute force</a> attacks, and no better attack
      is known.</p>
      <p>3DES can be somewhat slow compared to other ciphers. It requires
      three DES encryptions per block. DES was designed for hardware
      implementation and includes some operations which are difficult in
      software. However, the speed we get is quite acceptable for many uses.
      See our <a href="performance.html">performance</a> document for
      details.</p>

    <dd>An attack in which the attacker does not merely eavesdrop (see <a
      href="#passive">passive attack</a>) but takes action to change, delete,
      reroute, add, forge or divert data. Perhaps the best-known active
      attack is <a href="#middle">man-in-the-middle</a>. In general, <a
      href="#authentication">authentication</a> is a useful defense against

    <dd>The <b>A</b>dvanced <b>E</b>ncryption <b>S</b>tandard -- a new <a
      href="#block">block cipher</a> standard to replace <a
      href="politics.html#desnotsecure">DES</a> -- developed by <a
      href="#NIST">NIST</a>, the US National Institute of Standards and
      Technology. DES used 64-bit blocks and a 56-bit key. AES ciphers use a
      128-bit block and 128, 192 or 256-bit keys. The larger block size helps
      resist <a href="#birthday">birthday attacks</a> while the large key
      size prevents <a href="#brute">brute force attacks</a>.
      <p>Fifteen proposals meeting NIST's basic criteria were submitted in
      1998 and subjected to intense discussion and analysis, "round one"
      evaluation. In August 1999, NIST narrowed the field to five "round two"
      candidates:</p>
      <ul>

      </ul>
      <p>Three of the five finalists -- Rijndael, Serpent and Twofish -- have
      completely open licenses.</p>

  <dt><a name="authentication">Authentication</a></dt>
    <dd>Ensuring that a message originated from the expected sender and has
      not been altered on route. <a href="#IPSEC">IPsec</a> uses
      authentication in two places:
      <ul>
        <li>peer authentication, authenticating the players in <a
          href="#IKE">IKE</a>'s <a href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman</a> key
          exchanges to prevent <a href="#middle">man-in-the-middle
          attacks</a>. This can be done in a number of ways. The methods
          supported by FreeS/WAN are discussed in our <a
          href="adv_config.html#choose">advanced configuration</a>
        document.</li>
        <li>packet authentication, authenticating packets on an established
          <a href="#SA">SA</a>, either with a separate <a
          href="#AH">authentication header</a> or with the optional
          authentication in the <a href="#ESP">ESP</a> protocol. In either
          case, packet authentication uses a <a href="#HMAC">hashed message
          athentication code</a> technique.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Outside IPsec, passwords are perhaps the most common authentication
      mechanism. Their function is essentially to authenticate the person's
      identity to the system. Passwords are generally only as secure as the
      network they travel over. If you send a cleartext password over a
      tapped phone line or over a network with a packet sniffer on it, the
      security provided by that password becomes zero. Sending an encrypted
      password is no better; the attacker merely records it and reuses it at
      his convenience. This is called a <a href="#replay">replay</a>
      attack.</p>
      <p>A common solution to this problem is a <a
      href="#challenge">challenge-response</a> system. This defeats simple
      eavesdropping and replay attacks. Of course an attacker might still try
      to break the cryptographic algorithm used, or the <a
      href="#random">random number</a> generator.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><a name="auto">Automatic keying</a></dt>
    <dd>A mode in which keys are automatically generated at connection
      establisment and new keys automaically created periodically thereafter.
      Contrast with <a href="#manual">manual keying</a> in which a single
      stored key is used.
      <p>IPsec uses the <a href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman key exchange
      protocol</a> to create keys. An <a
      href="#authentication">authentication</a> mechansim is required for
      this. FreeS/WAN normally uses <a href="#RSA">RSA</a> for this. Other
      methods supported are discussed in our <a
      href="adv_config.html#choose">advanced configuration</a> document.</p>
      <p>Having an attacker break the authentication is emphatically not a
      good idea. An attacker that breaks authentication, and manages to
      subvert some other network entities (DNS, routers or gateways), can use
      a <a href="#middle">man-in-the middle attack</a> to break the security
      of your IPsec connections.</p>
      <p>However, having an attacker break the authentication in automatic
      keying is not quite as bad as losing the key in manual keying.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>An attacker who reads /etc/ipsec.conf and gets the keys for a
          manually keyed connection can, without further effort, read all
          messages encrypted with those keys, including any old messages he
          may have archived.</li>
        <li>Automatic keying has a property called <a href="#PFS">perfect
          forward secrecy</a>. An attacker who breaks the authentication gets
          none of the automatically generated keys and cannot immediately
          read any messages. He has to mount a successful <a
          href="#middle">man-in-the-middle attack</a> in real time before he
          can read anything. He cannot read old archived messages at all and
          will not be able to read any future messages not caught by
          man-in-the-middle tricks.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>That said, the secrets used for authentication, stored in <a
      href="manpage.d/ipsec.secrets.5.html">ipsec.secrets(5)</a>, should
      still be protected as tightly as cryptographic keys.</p>

    <dd>Our default block cipher, <a href="#3DES">triple DES</a>, is slower

      megabytes per second on a Pentium 200, according to the test program
      supplied with the library.

  <dt><a name="birthday">Birthday attack</a></dt>
    <dd>A cryptographic attack based on the mathematics exemplified by the <a
      href="#paradox">birthday paradox</a>. This math turns up whenever the
      question of two cryptographic operations producing the same result
      becomes an issue:

        <li><a href="#collision">collisions</a> in <a href="#digest">message

      </ul>
      <p>Resisting such attacks is part of the motivation for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>hash algorithms such as <a href="#SHA">SHA</a> and <a
          href="#RIPEMD">RIPEMD-160</a> giving a 160-bit result rather than
          the 128 bits of <a href="#MD4">MD4</a>, <a href="#MD5">MD5</a> and
          <a href="#RIPEMD">RIPEMD-128</a>.</li>
        <li><a href="#AES">AES</a> block ciphers using a 128-bit block

          href="#SA">SA</a> and requiring that the connection always be
          rekeyed before the counter overflows.</li>
      </ul>
    </dd>
  <dt><a name="paradox">Birthday paradox</a></dt>
    <dd>Not really a paradox, just a rather counter-intuitive mathematical
      fact. In a group of 23 people, the chance of a least one pair having
      the same birthday is over 50%.
      <p>The second person has 1 chance in 365 (ignoring leap years) of
      matching the first. If they don't match, the third person's chances of
      matching one of them are 2/365. The 4th, 3/365, and so on. The total of
      these chances grows more quickly than one might guess.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><a name="block">Block cipher</a></dt>
    <dd>A <a href="#symmetric">symmetric cipher</a> which operates on
      fixed-size blocks of plaintext, giving a block of ciphertext for each.
      Contrast with <a href="#stream"> stream cipher</a>. Block ciphers can
      be used in various <a href="#mode">modes</a> when multiple block are to
      be encrypted.
      <p><a href="#DES">DES</a> is among the the best known and widely used
      block ciphers, but is now obsolete. Its 56-bit key size makes it <a
      href="#desnotsecure">highly insecure</a> today. <a href="#3DES">Triple
      DES</a> is the default block cipher for <a href="#FreeSWAN">Linux
      FreeS/WAN</a>.</p>
      <p>The current generation of block ciphers -- such as <a
      href="#Blowfish">Blowfish</a>, <a href="#CAST128">CAST-128</a> and <a
      href="#IDEA">IDEA</a> -- all use 64-bit blocks and 128-bit keys. The
      next generation, <a href="#AES">AES</a>, uses 128-bit blocks and
      supports key sizes up to 256 bits.</p>

      used in several products.
      <p>This is not required by the <a href="#IPSEC">IPsec</a> RFCs and not
      currently used in <a href="#FreeSWAN">Linux FreeS/WAN</a>.</p>
    </dd>
  <dt><a name="brute">Brute force attack (exhaustive search)</a></dt>
    <dd>Breaking a cipher by trying all possible keys. This is always
      possible in theory (except against a <a href="#OTP">one-time pad</a>),
      but it becomes practical only if the key size is inadequate. For an
      important example, see our document on the <a
      href="#desnotsecure">insecurity of DES</a> with its 56-bit key. For an
      analysis of key sizes required to resist plausible brute force attacks,
      see <a href="http://www.counterpane.com/keylength.html">this paper</a>.
      <p>Longer keys protect against brute force attacks. Each extra bit in
      the key doubles the number of possible keys and therefore doubles the
      work a brute force attack must do. A large enough key defeats
      <strong>any</strong> brute force attack.</p>
      <p>For example, the EFF's <a href="#EFF">DES Cracker</a> searches a
      56-bit key space in an average of a few days. Let us assume an attacker
      that can find a 64-bit key (256 times harder) by brute force search in
      a second (a few hundred thousand times faster). For a 96-bit key, that
      attacker needs 2<sup>32</sup> seconds, about 135 years. Against a
      128-bit key, he needs 2<sup>32</sup> times that, over 500,000,000,000
      years. Your data is then obviously secure against brute force attacks.
      Even if our estimate of the attacker's speed is off by a factor of a
      million, it still takes him over 500,000 years to crack a message.</p>
      <p>This is why</p>
      <ul>
        <li>single <a href="#DES">DES</a> is now considered <a
          href="#desnotsecure">dangerously insecure</a></li>
        <li>all of the current generation of <a href="#block">block
          ciphers</a> use a 128-bit or longer key</li>
        <li><a href="#AES">AES</a> ciphers support keysizes 128, 192 and 256
          bits</li>
        <li>any cipher we add to Linux FreeS/WAN will have <em>at least</em>
          a 128-bit key</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong>Cautions:</strong><br>
      <em>Inadequate keylength always indicates a weak cipher</em> but it is
      important to note that <em>adequate keylength does not necessarily
      indicate a strong cipher</em>. There are many attacks other than brute
      force, and adequate keylength <em>only</em> guarantees resistance to
      brute force. Any cipher, whatever its key size, will be weak if design
      or implementation flaws allow other attacks.</p>
      <p>Also, <em>once you have adequate keylength</em> (somewhere around 90
      or 100 bits), <em>adding more key bits make no practical
      difference</em>, even against brute force. Consider our 128-bit example
      above that takes 500,000,000,000 years to break by brute force. We
      really don't care how many zeroes there are on the end of that, as long
      as the number remains ridiculously large. That is, we don't care
      exactly how large the key is as long as it is large enough.</p>
      <p>There may be reasons of convenience in the design of the cipher to
      support larger keys. For example <a href="#Blowfish">Blowfish</a>
      allows up to 448 bits and <a href="#RC4">RC4</a> up to 2048, but beyond
      100-odd bits it makes no difference to practical security.</p>

    <dd>This term has at least two distinct uses in discussing IPsec:
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>clients of an IPsec gateway</strong> are the machines
          it protects, typically on one or more subnets behind the gateway.
          In this usage, all the machines on an office network are clients of
          that office's IPsec gateway. Laptop or home machines connecting to
          the office, however, are <em>not</em> clients of that gateway. They
          are remote gateways, running the other end of an IPsec connection.
          Each of them is also its own client.</li>
        <li><strong>IPsec client software</strong> is used to describe
          software which runs on various standalone machines to let them
          connect to IPsec networks. In this usage, a laptop or home machine
          connecting to the office is a client, and the office gateway is the
          server.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We generally use the term in the first sense. Vendors of Windows

  <dt><a name="DOS">Denial of service (DoS) attack</a></dt>
    <dd>An attack that aims at denying some service to legitimate users of a
      system, rather than providing a service to the attacker.
      <ul>
        <li>One variant is a flooding attack, overwhelming the system with
          too many packets, to much email, or whatever.</li>
        <li>A closely related variant is a resource exhaustion attack. For
          example, consider a "TCP SYN flood" attack. Setting up a TCP
          connection involves a three-packet exchange:
          <ul>
            <li>Initiator: Connection please (SYN)</li>
            <li>Responder: OK (ACK)</li>
            <li>Initiator: OK here too</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If the attacker puts bogus source information in the first
          packet, such that the second is never delivered, the responder may
          wait a long time for the third to come back. If responder has
          already allocated memory for the connection data structures, and if
          many of these bogus packets arrive, the responder may run out of
          memory.</p>
        </li>
        <li>Another variant is to feed the system undigestible data, hoping
          to make it sick. For example, IP packets are limited in size to 64K
          bytes and a fragment carries information on where it starts within
          that 64K and how long it is. The "ping of death" delivers fragments
          that say, for example, that they start at 60K and are 20K long.
          Attempting to re-assemble these without checking for overflow can
          be fatal.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The two example attacks discussed were both quite effective when
      first discovered, capable of crashing or disabling many operating
      systems. They were also well-publicised, and today far fewer systems
      are vulnerable to them.</p>

  <dt><a name="dlog">discrete logarithm problem</a></dt>
    <dd>The problem of finding logarithms in a finite field. Given a field
      defintion (such definitions always include some operation analogous to
      multiplication) and two numbers, a base and a target, find the power
      which the base must be raised to in order to yield the target.
      <p>The discrete log problem is the basis of several cryptographic
      systems, including the <a href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman</a> key exchange
      used in the <a href="#IKE">IKE</a> protocol. The useful property is
      that exponentiation is relatively easy but the inverse operation,
      finding the logarithm, is hard. The cryptosystems are designed so that
      the user does only easy operations (exponentiation in the field) but an
      attacker must solve the hard problem (discrete log) to crack the
      system.</p>
      <p>There are several variants of the problem for different types of
      field. The IKE/Oakley key determination protocol uses two variants,
      either over a field modulo a prime or over a field defined by an
      elliptic curve. We give an example modulo a prime below. For the
      elliptic curve version, consult an advanced text such as <a
      href="biblio.html#handbook">Handbook of Applied Cryptography</a>.</p>
      <p>Given a prime <var>p</var>, a generator <var>g</var> for the field
      modulo that prime, and a number <var>x</var> in the field, the problem
      is to find <var>y</var> such that <var>g^y = x</var>.</p>
      <p>For example, let p = 13. The field is then the integers from 0 to
      12. Any integer equals one of these modulo 13. That is, the remainder
      when any integer is divided by 13 must be one of these.</p>
      <p>2 is a generator for this field.  That is, the powers of two modulo
      13 run through all the non-zero numbers in the field. Modulo 13 we
      have:</p>
      <pre>          y      x
        2^0  ==  1
        2^1  ==  2
        2^2  ==  4
        2^3  ==  8
        2^4  ==  3 that is, the remainder from 16/13 is 3
        2^5  ==  6          the remainder from 32/13 is 6
        2^6  == 12 and so on

      <p>Exponentiation in such a field is not difficult. Given, say,
      <nobr><var>y = 11</var>,</nobr>calculating <nobr><var>x =
      7</var></nobr>is straightforward. One method is just to calculate
      <nobr><var>2^11 = 2048</var>,</nobr>then <nobr><var>2048 mod 13 ==
      7</var>.</nobr>When the field is modulo a large prime (say a few 100
      digits) you need a silghtly cleverer method and even that is moderately
      expensive in computer time, but the calculation is still not
      problematic in any basic way.</p>
      <p>The discrete log problem is the reverse. In our example, given
      <nobr><var>x = 7</var>,</nobr>find the logarithm <nobr><var>y =
      11</var>.</nobr>When the field is modulo a large prime (or is based on
      a suitable elliptic curve), this is indeed problematic. No solution
      method that is not catastrophically expensive is known. Quite a few
      mathematicians have tackled this problem. No efficient method has been
      found and mathematicians do not expect that one will be. It seems
      likely no efficient solution to either of the main variants the
      discrete log problem exists.</p>
      <p>Note, however, that no-one has proven such methods do not exist. If
      a solution to either variant were found, the security of any crypto
      system using that variant would be destroyed.  This is one reason <a
      href="#IKE">IKE</a> supports two variants. If one is broken, we can

      <p>For example, the Internet may route all traffic for a particular

      problem to get packets to various machines on their <a

      treat a branch office like a subnet, giving it IP addresses "on" their

      <p>Packets bound for it are delivered to the corporate gateway, since
      as far as the outside world is concerned, that subnet is part of the
      corporate network. However, instead of going onto the corporate LAN (as

    <dd>An <a href="#active">active attack</a> in which the attacker
      impersonates each of the legitimate players in a protocol to the other.
      <p>For example, if <a href="#alicebob">Alice and Bob</a> are
      negotiating a key via the <a href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman</a> key
      agreement, and are not using <a
      href="#authentication">authentication</a> to be certain they are
      talking to each other, then an attacker able to insert himself in the
      communication path can deceive both players.</p>
      <p>Call the attacker Mallory. For Bob, he pretends to be Alice. For
      Alice, he pretends to be Bob. Two keys are then negotiated,
      Alice-to-Mallory and Bob-to-Mallory. Alice and Bob each think the key
      they have is Alice-to-Bob.</p>
      <p>A message from Alice to Bob then goes to Mallory who decrypts it,
      reads it and/or saves a copy, re-encrypts using the Bob-to-Mallory key
      and sends it along to Bob. Bob decrypts successfully and sends a reply
      which Mallory decrypts, reads, re-encrypts and forwards to Alice.</p>
      <p>To make this attack effective, Mallory must</p>
      <ul>
        <li>subvert some part of the network in some way that lets him carry
          out the deception<br>
          possible targets: DNS, router, Alice or Bob's machine, mail server,
          ...</li>
        <li>beat any authentication mechanism Alice and Bob use<br>
          strong authentication defeats the attack entirely; this is why <a
          href="#IKE">IKE</a> requires authentication</li>
        <li>work in real time, delivering messages without introducing a

          not hard if Alice and Bob are using email; quite difficult in some
          situations.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If he manages it, however, it is devastating. He not only gets to
      read all the messages; he can alter messages, inject his own, forge
      anything he likes, . . . In fact, he controls the communication
      completely.</p>

  <dt><a name="meet">Meet-in-the-middle attack</a></dt>
    <dd>A divide-and-conquer attack which breaks a cipher into two parts,
      works against each separately, and compares results. Probably the best
      known example is an attack on double DES. This applies in principle to
      any pair of block ciphers, e.g. to an encryption system using, say,
      CAST-128 and Blowfish, but we will describe it for double DES.
      <p>Double DES encryption and decryption can be written:</p>
      <pre>        C = E(k2,E(k1,P))
        P = D(k1,D(k2,C))</pre>
      <p>Where C is ciphertext, P is plaintext, E is encryption, D is
      decryption, k1 is one key, and k2 is the other key. If we know a P, C
      pair, we can try and find the keys with a brute force attack, trying
      all possible k1, k2 pairs. Since each key is 56 bits, there are
      2<sup>112</sup> such pairs and this attack is painfully inefficient.</p>
      <p>The meet-in-the middle attack re-writes the equations to calculate a
      middle value M:</p>
      <pre>        M = E(k1,P)
        M = D(k2,C)</pre>
      <p>Now we can try some large number of D(k2,C) decryptions with various
      values of k2 and store the results in a table. Then start doing E(k1,P)
      encryptions, checking each result to see if it is in the table.</p>
      <p>With enough table space, this breaks double DES with
      <nobr>2<sup>56</sup> + 2<sup>56</sup> = 2<sup>57</sup></nobr>work.
      Against triple DES, you need <nobr>2<sup>56</sup> + 2<sup>112</sup> ~=
      2<sup>112</sup></nobr>.</p>
      <p>The memory requirements for such attacks can be prohibitive, but
      there is a whole body of research literature on methods of reducing
      them.</p>

      <strong>U</strong>nit, the largest size of packet that can be sent over

      account of at the IP level.
      <p>IP packets, which can be up to 64K bytes each, must be packaged into
      lower-level packets of the appropriate size for the underlying
      network(s) and re-assembled on the other end. When a packet must pass
      over multiple networks, each with its own MTU, and many of the MTUs are
      unknown to the sender, this becomes a fairly complex problem. See <a
      href="#pathMTU">path MTU discovery</a> for details.</p>
      <p>Often the MTU is a few hundred bytes on serial links and 1500 on
      Ethernet. There are, however, serial link protocols which use a larger
      MTU to avoid fragmentation at the ethernet/serial boundary, and newer
      (especially gigabit) Ethernet networks sometimes support much larger
      packets because these are more efficient in some applications.</p>

      <p>Almost invariably, the phrase "non-routable address" means one of

      <ul>
        <li>10.anything</li>
        <li>172.x.anything with 16 &lt;= x &lt;= 31</li>

      </ul>
      <p>These addresses are commonly used on private networks, e.g. behind a

      the private network can address each other with these addresses. All

      replaced before they reach the Internet.</p>
      <p>If any packets using these addresses do leak out, they do not go
      far. Most routers automatically discard all such packets.</p>
      <p>Various other addresses -- the 127.0.0.0/8 block reserved for local
      use, 0.0.0.0, various broadcast and network addresses -- cannot be
      routed over the Internet, but are not normally included in the meaning

        <li>absolutely <a href="#random">random</a></li>
        <li>never re-used</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Given those three conditions, it can easily be proved that the
      cipher is perfectly secure, in the sense that an attacker with
      intercepted message in hand has no better chance of guessing the
      message than an attacker who has not intercepted the message and only
      knows the message length. No such proof exists for any other cipher.</p>
      <p>There are, however, several problems with this "perfect" cipher.</p>
      <p>First, it is <strong>wildly impractical</strong> for most
      applications. Key management is at best difficult, often completely
      impossible.</p>
      <p>Second, it is <strong>extremely fragile</strong>. Small changes
      which violate the conditions listed above do not just weaken the cipher
      liitle. Quite often they destroy its security completely.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Re-using the pad weakens the cipher to the point where it can be
          broken with pencil and paper. With a computer, the attack is
          trivially easy.</li>
        <li>Using <em>anything</em> less than truly <a
          href="#random">random</a> numbers <em>completely</em> invalidates
          the security proof.</li>
        <li>In particular, using computer-generated pseudo-random numbers may
          give an extremely weak cipher. It might also produce a good stream
          cipher, if the pseudo-random generator is both well-designed and
          properely seeded.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Marketing claims about the "unbreakable" security of various
      products which somewhat resemble one-time pads are common. Such claims
      are one of the surest signs of cryptographic <a href="#snake">snake
      oil</a>; most systems marketed with such claims are worthless.</p>
      <p>Finally, even if the system is implemented and used correctly, it is
      <strong>highly vulnerable to a substitution attack</strong>. If an
      attacker knows some plaintext and has an intercepted message, he can
      discover the pad.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>This does not matter if the attacker is just a <a
          href="#passive">passive</a> eavesdropper. It gives him no plaintext
          he didn't already know and we don't care that he learns a pad which
          we will never re-use.</li>
        <li>However, an <a href="#active">active</a> attacker who knows the
          plaintext can recover the pad, then use it to encode with whatever
          he chooses. If he can get his version delivered instead of yours,
          this may be a disaster. If you send "attack at dawn", the delivered
          message can be anything the same length -- perhaps "retreat to
          east" or "shoot generals".</li>
        <li>An active attacker with only a reasonable guess at the plaintext
          can try the same attack. If the guess is correct, this works and
          the attacker's bogus message is delivered. If the guess is wrong, a
          garbled message is delivered.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In general then, despite its theoretical perfection, the
      one-time-pad has very limited practical application.</p>

    <dd>The process of discovering the largest packet size which all links on
      a path can handle without fragmentation -- that is, without any router
      having to break the packet up into smaller pieces to match the <a
      href="#MTU">MTU</a> of its outgoing link.
      <p>This is done as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>originator sends the largest packets allowed by <a
          href="#MTU">MTU</a> of the first link, setting the DF
          (<strong>d</strong>on't <strong>f</strong>ragment) bit in the
          packet header</li>
        <li>any router which cannot send the packet on (outgoing MTU is too
          small for it, and DF prevents fragmenting it to match) sends back
          an <a href="#ICMP.gloss">ICMP</a> packet reporting the problem</li>
        <li>originator looks at ICMP message and tries a smaller size</li>
        <li>eventually, you settle on a size that can pass all routers</li>
        <li>thereafter, originator just sends that size and no-one has to
          fragment</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since this requires co-operation of many systems, and since the next
      packet may travel a different path, this is one of the trickier areas
      of IP programming. Bugs that have shown up over the years have
      included:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>malformed ICMP messages</li>
        <li>hosts that ignore or mishandle these ICMP messages</li>
        <li>firewalls blocking the ICMP messages so host does not see
        them</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Since IPsec adds a header, it increases packet size and may require
      fragmentation even where incoming and outgoing MTU are equal.</p>

  <dt><a name="PFS">Perfect forward secrecy (PFS)</a></dt>
    <dd>A property of systems such as <a href="#DH">Diffie-Hellman</a> key
      exchange which use a long-term key (such as the shared secret in IKE)
      and generate short-term keys as required. If an attacker who acquires
      the long-term key <em>provably</em> can
      <ul>
        <li><em>neither</em> read previous messages which he may have
        archived</li>
        <li><em>nor</em> read future messages without performing additional
          successful attacks</li>
      </ul>
      <p>then the system has PFS. The attacker needs the short-term keys in
      order to read the trafiic and merely having the long-term key does not
      allow him to infer those. Of course, it may allow him to conduct
      another attack (such as <a href="#middle">man-in-the-middle</a>) which
      gives him some short-term keys, but he does not automatically get them
      just by acquiring the long-term key.</p>

      key</a> algorithm, named for its three inventors. It is widely used and
      likely to become moreso since it became free of patent encumbrances in
      September 2000.
      <p>RSA can be used to provide either <a
      href="#encryption">encryption</a> or <a href="#signature">digital

      gateway-to-gateway <a href="#authentication">authentication</a> for <a
      href="#IKE">IKE </a>negotiations.</p>
      <p>For a full explanation of the algorithm, consult one of the standard
      references such as <a href="biblio.html#schneier">Applied
      Cryptography</a>. A simple explanation is:</p>
      <p>The great 17th century French mathematician <a
      href="http://www-groups.dcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/~history/Mathematicians/Fermat.html">Fermat</a>
      proved that,</p>
      <p>for any prime p and number x, 0 &lt;= x &lt; p:</p>
      <pre>        x^p == x         modulo p
        x^(p-1) == 1     modulo p, non-zero x
      </pre>
      <p>From this it follows that if we have a pair of primes p, q and two
      numbers e, d such that:</p>
      <pre>        ed == 1          modulo lcm( p-1, q-1)
      </pre>
      where lcm() is least common multiple, then<br>
      for all x, 0 &lt;= x &lt; pq:
      <pre>      x^ed == x           modulo pq
      </pre>
      <p>So we construct such as set of numbers p, q, e, d and publish the
      product N=pq and e as the public key. Using c for <a
      href="#ciphertext">ciphertext</a> and i for the input <a
      href="#plaintext">plaintext</a>, encryption is then:</p>
      <pre>        c = i^e           modulo N
      </pre>
      <p>An attacker cannot deduce i from the cyphertext c, short of either
      factoring N or solving the <a href="#dlog">discrete logarithm</a>
      problem for this field. If p, q are large primes (hundreds or thousands
      of bits) no efficient solution to either problem is known.</p>
      <p>The receiver, knowing the private key (N and d), can readily recover
      the plaintext p since:</p>
      <pre>        c^d == (i^e)^d    modulo N
            == i^ed       modulo N
            == i          modulo N
      </pre>
      <p>This gives an effective public key technique, with only a couple of
      problems. It uses a good deal of computer time, since calculations with
      large integers are not cheap, and there is no proof it is necessarily
      secure since no-one has proven either factoring or discrete log cannot
      be done efficiently. Quite a few good mathematicians have tried both
      problems, and no-one has announced success, but there is no proof they
      are insoluble.</p>

  <dt><a name="subnet">subnet</a></dt>
    <dd>A group of IP addresses which are logically one network, typically
      (but not always) assigned to a group of physically connected machines.
      The range of addresses in a subnet is described using a subnet mask.
      See next entry.</dd>
  <dt>subnet mask</dt>
    <dd>A method of indicating the addresses included in a subnet. Here are
      two equivalent examples:
      <ul>
        <li>101.101.101.0/24</li>
        <li>101.101.101.0 with mask 255.255.255.0</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The '24' is shorthand for a mask with the top 24 bits one and the
      rest zero. This is exactly the same as 255.255.255.0 which has three
      all-ones bytes and one all-zeros byte.</p>
      <p>These indicate that, for this range of addresses, the top 24 bits
      are to be treated as naming a network (often referred to as "the
      101.101.101.0/24 subnet") while most combinations of the low 8 bits can
      be used to designate machines on that network. Two addresses are
      reserved; 101.101.101.0 refers to the subnet rather than a specific
      machine while 101.101.101.255 is a broadcast address. 1 to 254 are
      available for machines.</p>
      <p>It is common to find subnets arranged in a hierarchy. For example, a
      large company might have a /16 subnet and allocate /24 subnets within
      that to departments. An ISP might have a large subnet and allocate /26
      subnets (64 addresses, 62 usable) to business customers and /29 subnets
      (8 addresses, 6 usable) to residential clients.</p>

    <dd>Secure Wide Area Network, a project involving <a href="#RSAco">RSA
      Data Security</a> and a number of other companies. The goal was to
      ensure that all their <a href="#IPSEC">IPsec</a> implementations would
      interoperate so that their customers can communicate with each other
      securely.</dd>
  <dt><a name="symmetric">Symmetric cryptography</a></dt>
    <dd>Symmetric cryptography, also referred to as conventional or secret
      key cryptography, relies on a <em>shared secret key</em>, identical for
      sender and receiver. Sender encrypts with that key, receiver decrypts
      with it. The idea is that an eavesdropper without the key be unable to
      read the messages. There are two main types of symmetric cipher, <a
      href="#block">block ciphers</a> and <a href="#stream">stream
      ciphers</a>.
      <p>Symmetric cryptography contrasts with <a href="#public">public
      key</a> or asymmetric systems where the two players use different
      keys.</p>
      <p>The great difficulty in symmetric cryptography is, of course, key
      management. Sender and receiver <em>must</em> have identical keys and
      those keys <em>must</em> be kept secret from everyone else. Not too
      much of a problem if only two people are involved and they can
      conveniently meet privately or employ a trusted courier. Quite a
      problem, though, in other circumstances.</p>
      <p>It gets much worse if there are many people. An application might be
      written to use only one key for communication among 100 people, for
      example, but there would be serious problems. Do you actually trust all
      of them that much? Do they trust each other that much? Should they?
      What is at risk if that key is compromised? How are you  going to
      distribute that key to everyone without risking its secrecy? What do
      you do when one of them leaves the company? Will you even know?</p>
      <p>On the other hand, if you need unique keys for every possible
      connection between a group of 100, then each user must have 99 keys.
      You need either 99*100/2 = 4950 <em>secure</em> key exchanges between
      users or a central authority that <em>securely</em> distributes 100 key
      packets, each with a different set of 99 keys.</p>
      <p>Either of these is possible, though tricky, for 100 users. Either
      becomes an administrative nightmare for larger numbers. Moreover, keys
      <em>must</em> be changed regularly, so the problem of key distribution
      comes up again and again. If you use the same key for many messages
      then an attacker has more text to work with in an attempt to crack that
      key. Moreover, one successful crack will give him or her the text of
      all those messages.</p>
      <p>In short, the <em>hardest part of conventional cryptography is key
      management</em>. Today the standard solution is to build a <a
      href="#hybrid">hybrid system</a> using <a href="#public">public key</a>
      techniques to manage keys.</p>

      preserve security, actually gave the game away.
      <p>In an industrial espionage situation, one might deduce something
      interesting just by knowing that company A and company B were talking,
      especially if one were able to tell which departments were involved, or
      if one already knew that A was looking for acquisitions and B was
      seeking funds for expansion.</p>
      <p>In general, traffic analysis by itself is not very useful. However,
      in the context of a larger intelligence effort where quite a bit is
      already known, it can be very useful. When you are solving a complex
      puzzle, every little bit helps.</p>
      <p><a href="#IPSEC">IPsec</a> itself does not defend against traffic
      analysis, but carefully thought out systems using IPsec can provide at

    <dd>The cryptographic part of the <a href="#IEEE">IEEE</a> standard for
      wireless LANs. As the name suggests, this is designed to be only as
      secure as a normal wired ethernet. Anyone with a network conection can
      tap it. Its advocates would claim this is good design, refusing to
      build in complex features beyond the actual requirements.
      <p>Critics refer to WEP as "Wire<em>tap</em> Equivalent Privacy", and
      consider it a horribly flawed design based on bogus "requirements". You
      do not control radio waves as you might control your wires, so the
      metaphor in the rationale is utterly inapplicable. A security policy
      that chooses not to invest resources in protecting against certain
      attacks which can only be conducted by people physically plugged into
      your LAN may or may not be reasonable. The same policy is completely
      unreasonable when someone can "plug in" from a laptop half a block
      away..</p>
      <p>There has been considerable analysis indicating that WEP is
      seriously flawed. A FAQ on attacks against WEP is available. Part of it
      reads:</p>

      <blockquote>
        ... attacks are practical to mount using only inexpensive
        off-the-shelf equipment. We recommend that anyone using an 802.11
        wireless network not rely on WEP for security, and employ other
        security measures to protect their wireless network. Note that our
        attacks apply to both 40-bit and the so-called 128-bit versions of
        WEP equally well.</blockquote>
      <p>WEP appears to be yet another instance of governments, and
      unfortunately some vendors and standards bodies, deliberately promoting
      hopelessly flawed "security" products, apparently mainly for the
