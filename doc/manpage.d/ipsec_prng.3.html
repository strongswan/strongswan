<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<I>Prng_init</I>

initializes a crypto-quality pseudo-random-number generator from a key;
<I>prng_bytes</I>

obtains pseudo-random bytes from it;
<I>prng_count</I>

reports the number of bytes extracted from it to date;
<I>prng_final</I>

closes it down.
It is the user's responsibility to initialize a PRNG before using it,
and not to use it again after it is closed down.
<P>

<I>Prng_init</I>

initializes,
or re-initializes,
the specified
<I>prng</I>

from the
<I>key</I>,

whose length is given by
<I>keylen</I>.

The user must allocate the
<B>struct prng</B>

pointed to by
<I>prng</I>.

There is no particular constraint on the length of the key,
although a key longer than 256 bytes is unnecessary because
only the first 256 would be used.
Initialization requires on the order of 3000 integer operations,
independent of key length.
<P>

<I>Prng_bytes</I>

obtains
<I>dstlen</I>

pseudo-random bytes from the PRNG and puts them in
<I>buf</I>.

This is quite fast,
on the order of 10 integer operations per byte.
<P>

<I>Prng_count</I>

reports the number of bytes obtained from the PRNG
since it was (last) initialized.
<P>

<I>Prng_final</I>

closes down a PRNG by
zeroing its internal memory,
obliterating all trace of the state used to generate its previous output.
This requires on the order of 250 integer operations.
<P>

The
<B>&lt;<A HREF="file:/usr/include/freeswan.h">freeswan.h</A>&gt;</B>

header file supplies the definition of the
<B>prng</B>

structure.
Examination of its innards is discouraged, as they may change.
<P>

The PRNG algorithm
used by these functions is currently identical to that of RC4(TM).
This algorithm is cryptographically strong,
sufficiently unpredictable that even a hostile observer will
have difficulty determining the next byte of output from past history,
provided it is initialized from a reasonably large key composed of
highly random bytes (see
<I><A HREF="random.4.html">random</A></I>(4)).

The usual run of software pseudo-random-number generators
(e.g.
<I><A HREF="random.3.html">random</A></I>(3))

are
<I>not</I>

cryptographically strong.
<P>

The well-known attacks against RC4(TM),
e.g. as found in 802.11b's WEP encryption system,
apply only if multiple PRNGs are initialized with closely-related keys
(e.g., using a counter appended to a base key).
If such keys are used, the first few hundred pseudo-random bytes
from each PRNG should be discarded,
to give the PRNGs a chance to randomize their innards properly.
No useful attacks are known if the key is well randomized to begin with.

<H2>BUGS</H2>

If an attempt is made to obtain more than 4e9 bytes
between initializations,
the PRNG will continue to work but
<I>prng_count</I>'s

output will stick at
<B>4000000000</B>.

Fixing this would require a longer integer type and does
not seem worth the trouble,
since you should probably re-initialize before then anyway...
