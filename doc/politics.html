<H1><A name="politics">History and politics of cryptography</A></H1>
<P>Cryptography has a long and interesting history, and has been the
 subject of considerable political controversy.</P>
<H2><A name="intro.politics">Introduction</A></H2>
<H3><A NAME="26_1_1">History</A></H3>
<P>The classic book on the history of cryptography is David Kahn's<A href="biblio.html#Kahn">
 The Codebreakers</A>. It traces codes and codebreaking from ancient
 Egypt to the 20th century.</P>
<P>Diffie and Landau<A href="biblio.html#diffie"> Privacy on the Line:
 The Politics of Wiretapping and Encryption</A> covers the history from
 the First World War to the 1990s, with an emphasis on the US.</P>
<H4>World War II</H4>
<P>During the Second World War, the British &quot;Ultra&quot; project achieved one
 of the greatest intelligence triumphs in the history of warfare,
 breaking many Axis codes. One major target was the Enigma cipher
 machine, a German device whose users were convinced it was unbreakable.
 The American &quot;Magic&quot; project had some similar triumphs against Japanese
 codes.</P>
<P>There are many books on this period. See our bibliography for
 several. Two I particularly like are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Andrew Hodges has done a superb<A href="http://www.turing.org.uk/book/">
 biography</A> of Alan Turing, a key player among the Ultra
 codebreakers. Turing was also an important computer pioneer. The terms<A
href="http://www.abelard.org/turpap/turpap.htm"> Turing test</A> and<A href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/turing-machine/">
 Turing machine</A> are named for him, as is the<A href="http://www.acm.org">
 ACM</A>'s highest technical<A href="http://www.acm.org/awards/taward.html">
 award</A>.</LI>
<LI>Neal Stephenson's<A href="biblio.html#neal"> Cryptonomicon</A> is a
 novel with cryptography central to the plot. Parts of it take place
 during WW II, other parts today.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Bletchley Park, where much of the Ultra work was done, now has a
 museum and a<A href="http://www.bletchleypark.org.uk/"> web site</A>.</P>
<P>The Ultra work introduced three major innovations.</P>
<UL>
<LI>The first break of Enigma was achieved by Polish Intelligence in
 1931. Until then most code-breakers had been linguists, but a different
 approach was needed to break machine ciphers. Polish Intelligence
 recruited bright young mathematicians to crack the &quot;unbreakable&quot;
 Enigma. When war came in 1939, the Poles told their allies about this,
 putting Britain on the road to Ultra. The British also adopted a
 mathematical approach.</LI>
<LI>Machines were extensively used in the attacks. First the Polish
 &quot;Bombe&quot; for attacking Enigma, then British versions of it, then
 machines such as Collosus for attacking other codes. By the end of the
 war, some of these machines were beginning to closely resemble digital
 computers. After the war, a team at Manchester University, several old
 Ultra hands included, built one of the world's first actual
 general-purpose digital computers.</LI>
<LI>Ultra made codebreaking a large-scale enterprise, producing
 intelligence on an industrial scale. This was not a &quot;black chamber&quot;,
 not a hidden room in some obscure government building with a small crew
 of code-breakers. The whole operation -- from wholesale interception of
 enemy communications by stations around the world, through large-scale
 code-breaking and analysis of the decrypted material (with an enormous
 set of files for cross-referencing), to delivery of intelligence to
 field commanders -- was huge, and very carefully managed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>So by the end of the war, Allied code-breakers were expert at
 large-scale mechanised code-breaking. The payoffs were enormous.</P>
<H4><A name="postwar">Postwar and Cold War</A></H4>
<P>The wartime innovations were enthusiastically adopted by post-war and
 Cold War signals intelligence agencies. Presumably many nations now
 have some agency capable of sophisticated attacks on communications
 security, and quite a few engage in such activity on a large scale.</P>
<P>America's<A href="glossary.html#NSA"> NSA</A>, for example, is said
 to be both the world's largest employer of mathematicians and the
 world's largest purchaser of computer equipment. Such claims may be
 somewhat exaggerated, but beyond doubt the NSA -- and similar agencies
 in other countries -- have some excellent mathematicians, lots of
 powerful computers, sophisticated software, and the organisation and
 funding to apply them on a large scale. Details of the NSA budget are
 secret, but there are some published<A href="http://www.fas.org/irp/nsa/nsabudget.html">
 estimates</A>.</P>
<P>Changes in the world's communications systems since WW II have
 provided these agencies with new targets. Cracking the codes used on an
 enemy's military or diplomatic communications has been common practice
 for centuries. Extensive use of radio in war made large-scale attacks
 such as Ultra possible. Modern communications make it possible to go
 far beyond that. Consider listening in on cell phones, or intercepting
 electronic mail, or tapping into the huge volumes of data on new media
 such as fiber optics or satellite links. None of these targets existed
 in 1950. All of them can be attacked today, and almost certainly are
 being attacked.</P>
<P>The Ultra story was not made public until the 1970s. Much of the
 recent history of codes and code-breaking has not been made public, and
 some of it may never be. Two important books are:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Bamford's<A href="biblio.html#puzzle"> The Puzzle Palace</A>, a
 history of the NSA</LI>
<LI>Hager's<A href="http://www.fas.org/irp/eprint/sp/index.html"> Secret
 Power</A>, about the<A href="http://sg.yahoo.com/government/intelligence/echelon_network/">
 Echelon</A> system -- the US, UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand
 co-operating to monitor much of the world's communications.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Note that these books cover only part of what is actually going on,
 and then only the activities of nations open and democratic enough that
 (some of) what they are doing can be discovered. A full picture,
 including:</P>
<UL>
<LI>actions of the English-speaking democracies not covered in those
 books</LI>
<LI>actions of other more-or-less sane governments</LI>
<LI>the activities of various more-or-less insane governments</LI>
<LI>possibilities for unauthorized action by government employees</LI>
<LI>possible actions by large non-government organisations:
 corporations, criminals, or conspiracies</LI>
</UL>
<P>might be really frightening.</P>
<H4><A name="recent">Recent history -- the crypto wars</A></H4>
<P>Until quite recently, cryptography was primarily a concern of
 governments, especially of the military, of spies, and of diplomats.
 Much of it was extremely secret.</P>
<P>In recent years, that has changed a great deal. With computers and
 networking becoming ubiquitous, cryptography is now important to almost
 everyone. Among the developments since the 1970s:</P>
<UL>
<LI>The US gov't established the Data Encryption Standard,<A href="glossary.html#DES">
 DES</A>, a<A href="glossary.html#block"> block cipher</A> for
 cryptographic protection of unclassfied documents.</LI>
<LI>DES also became widely used in industry, especially regulated
 industries such as banking.</LI>
<LI>Other nations produced their own standards, such as<A href="glossary.html#GOST">
 GOST</A> in the Soviet Union.</LI>
<LI><A href="glossary.html#public">Public key</A> cryptography was
 invented by Diffie and Hellman.</LI>
<LI>Academic conferences such as<A href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/users/mihir/crypto2k.html">
 Crypto</A> and<A href="http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/cosic/eurocrypt2000/">
 Eurocrypt</A> began.</LI>
<LI>Several companies began offerring cryptographic products:<A href="glossary.html#RSAco">
 RSA</A>,<A href="glossary.html#PGPI"> PGP</A>, the many vendors with<A href="glossary.html#PKI">
 PKI</A> products, ...</LI>
<LI>Cryptography appeared in other products: operating systems, word
 processors, ...</LI>
<LI>Network protocols based on crypto were developed:<A href="glossary.html#SSH">
 SSH</A>,<A href="glossary.html#SSL"> SSL</A>,<A href="glossary.html#IPsec">
 IPsec</A>, ...</LI>
<LI>Crytography came into widespread use to secure bank cards,
 terminals, ...</LI>
<LI>The US government replaced<A href="glossary.html#DES"> DES</A> with
 the much stronger Advanced Encryption Standard,<A href="glossary.html#AES">
 AES</A></LI>
</UL>
<P>This has led to a complex ongoing battle between various mainly
 government groups wanting to control the spread of crypto and various
 others, notably the computer industry and the<A href="http://online.offshore.com.ai/security/">
 cypherpunk</A> crypto advocates, wanting to encourage widespread use.</P>
<P>Steven Levy has written a fine history of much of this, called<A href="biblio.html#crypto">
 Crypto: How the Code rebels Beat the Government -- Saving Privacy in
 the Digital Age</A>.</P>
<P>The FreeS/WAN project is to a large extent an outgrowth of cypherpunk
 ideas. Our reasons for doing the project can be seen in these quotes
 from the<A href="http://www.eff.org/pub/Privacy/Crypto_misc/cypherpunk.manifesto">
 Cypherpunk Manifesto</A>:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Privacy is necessary for an open society in the electronic
 age. ...
<P>We cannot expect governments, corporations, or other large, faceless
 organizations to grant us privacy out of their beneficence. It is to
 their advantage to speak of us, and we should expect that they will
 speak. ...</P>
<P>We must defend our own privacy if we expect to have any. ...</P>
<P>Cypherpunks write code. We know that someone has to write software to
 defend privacy, and since we can't get privacy unless we all do, we're
 going to write it. We publish our code so that our fellow Cypherpunks
 may practice and play with it. Our code is free for all to use,
 worldwide. We don't much care if you don't approve of the software we
 write. We know that software can't be destroyed and that a widely
 dispersed system can't be shut down.</P>
<P>Cypherpunks deplore regulations on cryptography, for encryption is
 fundamentally a private act. ...</P>
<P>For privacy to be widespread it must be part of a social contract.
 People must come and together deploy these systems for the common good.
 ...</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>To quote project leader John Gilmore:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> We are literally in a race between our ability to build and
 deploy technology, and their ability to build and deploy laws and
 treaties. Neither side is likely to back down or wise up until it has
 definitively lost the race.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>If FreeS/WAN reaches its goal of making<A href="intro.html#opp.intro">
 opportunistic encryption</A> widespread so that secure communication
 can become the default for a large part of the net, we will have struck
 a major blow.</P>
<H3><A name="intro.poli">Politics</A></H3>
<P>The political problem is that nearly all governments want to monitor
 their enemies' communications, and some want to monitor their citizens.
 They may be very interested in protecting some of their own
 communications, and often some types of business communication, but not
 in having everyone able to communicate securely. They therefore attempt
 to restrict availability of strong cryptography as much as possible.</P>
<P>Things various governments have tried or are trying include:</P>

<H3><A name="gilmore">Swan: Securing the Internet against Wiretapping</A>
</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>My project for 1996 was to<B> secure 5% of the Internet traffic
 against passive wiretapping</B>. It didn't happen in 1996, so I'm still
 working on it in 1997, 1998, and 1999! If we get 5% in 1999 or 2000, we
 can secure 20% the next year, against both active and passive attacks;
 and 80% the following year. Soon the whole Internet will be private and
 secure. The project is called S/WAN or S/Wan or Swan for Secure Wide
 Area Network; since it's free software, we call it FreeSwan to
 distinguish it from various commercial implementations.<A href="http://www.rsa.com/rsa/SWAN/">
 RSA</A> came up with the term &quot;S/WAN&quot;. Our main web site is at<A href="http://www.freeswan.org/">
 http://www.freeswan.org/</A>. Want to help?</P>
<P>The idea is to deploy PC-based boxes that will sit between your local
 area network and the Internet (near your firewall or router) which
 opportunistically encrypt your Internet packets. Whenever you talk to a
 machine (like a Web site) that doesn't support encryption, your traffic
 goes out &quot;in the clear&quot; as usual. Whenever you connect to a machine
 that does support this kind of encryption, this box automatically
 encrypts all your packets, and decrypts the ones that come in. In
 effect, each packet gets put into an &quot;envelope&quot; on one side of the net,
 and removed from the envelope when it reaches its destination. This
 works for all kinds of Internet traffic, including Web access, Telnet,
 FTP, email, IRC, Usenet, etc.</P>
<P>The encryption boxes are standard PC's that use freely available
 Linux software that you can download over the Internet or install from
 a cheap CDROM.</P>
<P>This wasn't just my idea; lots of people have been working on it for
 years. The encryption protocols for these boxes are called<A href="glossary.html#IPsec">
 IPSEC (IP Security)</A>. They have been developed by the<A href="http://www.ietf.cnri.reston.va.us/html.charters/ipsec-charter.html">
 IP Security Working Group</A> of the<A href="http://www.ietf.org/">
 Internet Engineering Task Force</A>, and will be a standard part of the
 next major version of the Internet protocols (<A href="http://playground.sun.com/pub/ipng/html/ipng-main.html">
IPv6</A>). For today's (IP version 4) Internet, they are an option.</P>
<P>The<A href="http://www.iab.org/iab"> Internet Architecture Board</A>
 and<A href="http://www.ietf.org/"> Internet Engineering Steering Group</A>
 have taken a<A href="iab-iesg.stmt"> strong stand</A> that the Internet
 should use powerful encryption to provide security and privacy. I think
 these protocols are the best chance to do that, because they can be
 deployed very easily, without changing your hardware or software or
 retraining your users. They offer the best security we know how to
 build, using the Triple-DES, RSA, and Diffie-Hellman algorithms.</P>
<P>This &quot;opportunistic encryption box&quot; offers the &quot;fax effect&quot;. As each
 person installs one for their own use, it becomes more valuable for
 their neighbors to install one too, because there's one more person to
 use it with. The software automatically notices each newly installed
 box, and doesn't require a network administrator to reconfigure it.
 Instead of &quot;virtual private networks&quot; we have a &quot;REAL private network&quot;;
 we add privacy to the real network instead of layering a
 manually-maintained virtual network on top of an insecure Internet.</P>
<H4>Deployment of IPSEC</H4>
<P>The US government would like to control the deployment of IP Security
 with its<A href="#exlaw"> crypto export laws</A>. This isn't a problem
 for my effort, because the cryptographic work is happening outside the
 United States. A foreign philanthropist, and others, have donated the
 resources required to add these protocols to the Linux operating
 system.<A href="http://www.linux.org/"> Linux</A> is a complete, freely
 available operating system for IBM PC's and several kinds of
 workstation, which is compatible with Unix. It was written by Linus
 Torvalds, and is still maintained by a talented team of expert
 programmers working all over the world and coordinating over the
 Internet. Linux is distributed under the<A href="glossary.html#GPL">
 GNU Public License</A>, which gives everyone the right to copy it,
 improve it, give it to their friends, sell it commercially, or do just
 about anything else with it, without paying anyone for the privilege.</P>
<P>Organizations that want to secure their network will be able to put
 two Ethernet cards into an IBM PC, install Linux on it from a $30 CDROM
 or by downloading it over the net, and plug it in between their
 Ethernet and their Internet link or firewall. That's all they'll have
 to do to encrypt their Internet traffic everywhere outside their own
 local area network.</P>
<P>Travelers will be able to run Linux on their laptops, to secure their
 connection back to their home network (and to everywhere else that they
 connect to, such as customer sites). Anyone who runs Linux on a
 standalone PC will also be able to secure their network connections,
 without changing their application software or how they operate their
 computer from day to day.</P>
<P>There will also be numerous commercially available firewalls that use
 this technology.<A href="http://www.rsa.com/"> RSA Data Security</A> is
 coordinating the<A href="http://www.rsa.com/rsa/SWAN"> S/Wan (Secure
 Wide Area Network)</A> project among more than a dozen vendors who use
 these protocols. There's a<A href="http://www.rsa.com/rsa/SWAN/swan_test.htm">
 compatability chart</A> that shows which vendors have tested their
 boxes against which other vendors to guarantee interoperatility.</P>
<P>Eventually it will also move into the operating systems and
 networking protocol stacks of major vendors. This will probably take
 longer, because those vendors will have to figure out what they want to
 do about the export controls.</P>
<H4>Current status</H4>
<P>My initial goal of securing 5% of the net by Christmas '96 was not
 met. It was an ambitious goal, and inspired me and others to work hard,
 but was ultimately too ambitious. The protocols were in an early stage
 of development, and needed a lot more protocol design before they could
 be implemented. As of April 1999, we have released version 1.0 of the
 software (<A href="ftp://ftp.xs4all.nl/freeswan/freeswan-1.0.tar.gz">
freeswan-1.0.tar.gz</A>), which is suitable for setting up Virtual
 Private Networks using shared secrets for authentication. It does not
 yet do opportunistic encryption, or use DNSSEC for authentication;
 those features are coming in a future release.</P>
<DL>
<DT>Protocols</DT>
<DD>The low-level encrypted packet formats are defined. The system for
 publishing keys and providing secure domain name service is defined.
 The IP Security working group has settled on an NSA-sponsored protocol
 for key agreement (called ISAKMP/Oakley), but it is still being worked
 on, as the protocol and its documentation is too complex and
 incomplete. There are prototype implementations of ISAKMP. The protocol
 is not yet defined to enable opportunistic encryption or the use of
 DNSSEC keys.</DD>
<DT>Linux Implementation</DT>
<DD>The Linux implementation has reached its first major release and is
 ready for production use in manually-configured networks, using Linux
 kernel version 2.0.36.</DD>
<DT>Domain Name System Security</DT>
<DD>There is now a release of BIND 8.2 that includes most DNS Security
 features.
<P>The first prototype implementation of Domain Name System Security was
 funded by<A href="glossary.html#DARPA"> DARPA</A> as part of their<A href="http://www.darpa.mil/ito/research/is/index.html">
 Information Survivability program</A>.<A href="http://www.tis.com">
 Trusted Information Systems</A> wrote a modified version of<A href="http://www.isc.org/bind.html">
 BIND</A>, the widely-used Berkeley implementation of the Domain Name
 System.</P>
<P>TIS, ISC, and I merged the prototype into the standard version of
 BIND. The first production version that supports KEY and SIG records is<B>
 bind-4.9.5</B>. This or any later version of BIND will do for
 publishing keys. It is available from the<A href="http://www.isc.org/bind.html">
 Internet Software Consortium</A>. This version of BIND is not
 export-controlled since it does not contain any cryptography. Later
 releases starting with BIND 8.2 include cryptography for authenticating
 DNS records, which is also exportable. Better documentation is needed.</P>

</DL>
<H4>Why?</H4>
<P>Because I can. I have made enough money from several successful
 startup companies, that for a while I don't have to work to support
 myself. I spend my energies and money creating the kind of world that
 I'd like to live in and that I'd like my (future) kids to live in.
 Keeping and improving on the civil rights we have in the United States,
 as we move more of our lives into cyberspace, is a particular goal of
 mine.</P>
<H4>What You Can Do</H4>
<DL>
<DT>Install the latest BIND at your site.</DT>
<DD>You won't be able to publish any keys for your domain, until you
 have upgraded your copy of BIND. The thing you really need from it is
 the new version of<I> named</I>, the Name Daemon, which knows about the
 new KEY and SIG record types. So, download it from the<A href="http://www.isc.org/bind.html">
 Internet Software Consortium</A> and install it on your name server
 machine (or get your system administrator, or Internet Service
 Provider, to install it). Both your primary DNS site and all of your
 secondary DNS sites will need the new release before you will be able
 to publish your keys. You can tell which sites this is by running the
 Unix command &quot;dig MYDOMAIN ns&quot; and seeing which sites are mentioned in
 your NS (name server) records.</DD>
<DT>Set up a Linux system and run a 2.0.x kernel on it</DT>
<DD>Get a machine running Linux (say the 5.2 release from<A href="http://www.redhat.com">
 Red Hat</A>). Give the machine two Ethernet cards.</DD>
<DT>Install the Linux IPSEC (Freeswan) software</DT>
<DD>If you're an experienced sysadmin or Linux hacker, install the
 freeswan-1.0 release, or any later release or snapshot. These releases
 do NOT provide automated &quot;opportunistic&quot; operation; they must be
 manually configured for each site you wish to encrypt with.</DD>
<DT>Get on the linux-ipsec mailing list</DT>
<DD>The discussion forum for people working on the project, and testing
 the code and documentation, is: linux-ipsec@clinet.fi. To join this
 mailing list, send email to<A href="mailto:linux-ipsec-REQUEST@clinet.fi">
 linux-ipsec-REQUEST@clinet.fi</A> containing a line of text that says
 &quot;subscribe linux-ipsec&quot;. (You can later get off the mailing list the
 same way -- just send &quot;unsubscribe linux-ipsec&quot;).</DD>
<P></P>
<DT>Check back at this web page every once in a while</DT>
<DD>I update this page periodically, and there may be new information in
 it that you haven't seen. My intent is to send email to the mailing
 list when I update the page in any significant way, so subscribing to
 the list is an alternative.</DD>
</DL>
<P>Would you like to help? I can use people who are willing to write
 documentation, install early releases for testing, write cryptographic
 code outside the United States, sell pre-packaged software or systems
 including this technology, and teach classes for network administrators
 who want to install this technology. To offer to help, send me email at
 gnu@toad.com. Tell me what country you live in and what your
 citizenship is (it matters due to the export control laws; personally I
 don't care). Include a copy of your resume and the URL of your home
 page. Describe what you'd like to do for the project, and what you're
 uniquely qualified for. Mention what other volunteer projects you've
 been involved in (and how they worked out). Helping out will require
 that you be able to commit to doing particular things, meet your
 commitments, and be responsive by email. Volunteer projects just don't
 work without those things.</P>

<PRE>John Denker wrote:

&gt; Indeed there are several ways in which the documentation overstates the 
&gt; scope of what this project does -- starting with the name 
&gt; FreeS/WAN.  There's a big difference between having an encrypted IP tunnel 
&gt; versus having a Secure Wide-Area Network.  This software does a fine job of 
&gt; the former, which is necessary but not sufficient for the latter.

The goal of the project is to make it very hard to tap your wide area
communications.  The current system provides very good protection
against passive attacks (wiretapping and those big antenna farms).
Active attacks, which involve the intruder sending packets to your
system (like packets that break into sendmail and give them a root
shell :-) are much harder to guard against.  Active attacks that
involve sending people (breaking into your house and replacing parts
of your computer with ones that transmit what you're doing) are also
much harder to guard against.  Though we are putting effort into
protecting against active attacks, it's a much bigger job than merely
providing strong encryption.  It involves general computer security,
and general physical security, which are two very expensive problems
for even a site to solve, let alone to build into a whole society.

The societal benefit of building an infrastructure that protects
well against passive attacks is that it makes it much harder to do
undetected bulk monitoring of the population.  It's a defense against
police-states, not against policemen.

Policemen can put in the effort required to actively attack sites that
they have strong suspicions about.  But police states won't be able to
build systems that automatically monitor everyone's communications.
Either they will be able to monitor only a small subset of the
populace (by targeting those who screwed up their passive security),
or their monitoring activities will be detectable by those monitored
(active attacks leave packet traces or footprints), which can then be
addressed through the press and through political means if they become
too widespread.

FreeS/WAN does not protect very well against traffic analysis, which
is a kind of widespread police-state style monitoring that still
reveals significant information (who's talking to who) without
revealing the contents of what was said.  Defenses against traffic
analysis are an open research problem.  Zero Knowledge Systems is
actively deploying a system designed to thwart it, designed by Ian
Goldberg.  The jury is out on whether it actually works; a lot more
experience with it will be needed.</PRE>

<UL>
<LI>weak systems are sufficient for some data</LI>
<LI>strong cryptography should be reserved for cases where the extra

</UL>
<P><STRONG>This is utter nonsense</STRONG>.</P>
<P>Weak systems touted include:</P>
<UL>
<LI>the ludicrously weak (deliberately crippled) 40-bit ciphers that
 until recently were all various<A href="#exlaw"> export laws</A>
 allowed</LI>
<LI>56-bit single DES, discussed<A href="#desnotsecure"> below</A></LI>
<LI>64-bit symmetric ciphers and 512-bit RSA, the maximums for
 unrestricted export under various current laws</LI>
</UL>
<P>The notion that choice of ciphers or keysize should be determined by
 a trade-off between security requirements and overheads is pure
 bafflegab.</P>
<UL>
<LI>For most<A href="glossary.html#symmetric"> symmetric ciphers</A>, it
 is simply a lie. Any block cipher has some natural maximum keysize
 inherent in the design -- 128 bits for<A href="glossary.html#IDEA">
 IDEA</A> or<A href="glossary.html#CAST128"> CAST-128</A>, 256 for
 Serpent or Twofish, 448 for<A href="glossary.html#Blowfish"> Blowfish</A>
 and 2048 for<A href="glossary.html#RC4"> RC4</A>. Using a key size
 smaller than that limit gives<EM> exactly zero</EM> savings in
 overhead. The crippled 40-bit or 64-bit version of the cipher provides<EM>
 no advantage whatsoever</EM>.</LI>
<LI><A href="glossary.html#AES">AES</A> uses 10 rounds with 128-bit
 keys, 12 rounds for 192-bit and 14 rounds for 256-bit, so there
 actually is a small difference in overhead, but not enough to matter in
 most applications.</LI>
<LI>For<A href="glossary.html#3DES"> triple DES</A> there is a grain of
 truth in the argument. 3DES is indeed three times slower than single
 DES. However, the solution is not to use the insecure single DES, but
 to pick a faster secure cipher.<A href="glossary.html#CAST128">
 CAST-128</A>,<A href="glossary.html#Blowfish"> Blowfish</A> and the<A href="glossary.html#AES">
 AES candidate</A> ciphers are are all considerably faster in software
 than DES (let alone 3DES!), and apparently secure.</LI>
<LI>For<A href="glossary.html#public"> public key</A> techniques, there
 are extra overheads for larger keys, but they generally do not affect
 overall performance significantly. Practical public key applications
 are usually<A href="glossary.html#hybrid"> hybrid</A> systems in which
 the bulk of the work is done by a symmetric cipher. The effect of
 increasing the cost of the public key operations is typically
 negligible because the public key operations use only a tiny fraction
 of total resources.
<P>For example, suppose public key operations use use 1% of the time in
 a hybrid system and you triple the cost of public key operations. The
 cost of symmetric cipher operations is unchanged at 99% of the original
 total cost, so the overall effect is a jump from 99 + 1 = 100 to 99 + 3
 = 102, a 2% rise in system cost.</P>
</LI>
</UL>
<P>In short,<STRONG> there has never been any technical reason to use
 inadequate ciphers</STRONG>. The only reason there has ever been for
 anyone to use such ciphers is that government agencies want weak
 ciphers used so that they can crack them. The alleged savings are
 simply propaganda.</P>

<P>Our policy in FreeS/WAN is to use only cryptographic components with
 adequate keylength and no known weaknesses.</P>
<UL>
<LI>We do not implement single DES because it is clearly<A href="#desnotsecure">
 insecure</A>, so implemeting it would violate our policy of avoiding
 bogus security. Our default cipher is<A href="glossary.html#3DES"> 3DES</A>
</LI>
<LI>Similarly, we do not implement the 768-bit Group 1 for<A href="glossary.html#DH">

 2 and 1536-bit Group 5.</LI>
</UL>
<P>Detailed discussion of which IPsec features we implement or omit is

<P>These decisions imply that we cannot fully conform to the IPsec RFCs,
 since those have DES as the only required cipher and Group 1 as the
 only required DH group. (In our view, the standards were subverted into
 offerring bogus security.) Fortunately, we can still interoperate with
 most other IPsec implementations since nearly all implementers provide
 at least 3DES and Group 2 as well.</P>
<P>We hope that eventually the RFCs will catch up with our (and others')
 current practice and reject dubious components. Some of our team and a
 number of others are working on this in<A href="glossary.html#IETF">
 IETF</A> working groups.</P>
<H4>Some real trade-offs</H4>
<P>Of course, making systems secure does involve costs, and trade-offs
 can be made between cost and security. However, the real trade-offs
 have nothing to do with using weaker ciphers.</P>
<P>There can be substantial hardware and software costs. There are often
 substantial training costs, both to train administrators and to
 increase user awareness of security issues and procedures. There are
 almost always substantial staff or contracting costs.</P>
<P>Security takes staff time for planning, implementation, testing and
 auditing. Some of the issues are subtle; you need good (hence often
 expensive) people for this. You also need people to monitor your
 systems and respond to problems. The best safe ever built is insecure
 if an attacker can work on it for days without anyone noticing. Any
 computer is insecure if the administrator is &quot;too busy&quot; to check the
 logs.</P>
<P>Moreover, someone in your organisation (or on contract to it) needs
 to spend considerable time keeping up with new developments. EvilDoers<EM>
 will</EM> know about new attacks shortly after they are found. You need
 to know about them before your systems are attacked. If your vendor
 provides a patch, you need to apply it. If the vendor does nothing, you
 need to complain or start looking for another vendor.</P>
<P>For a fairly awful example, see this<A href="http://www.sans.org/newlook/alerts/NTE-bank.htm">
 report</A>. In that case over a million credit card numbers were taken
 from e-commerce sites, using security flaws in Windows NT servers.
 Microsoft had long since released patches for most or all of the flaws,
 but the site administrators had not applied them.</P>
<P>At an absolute minimum, you must do something about such issues<EM>
 before</EM> an exploitation tool is posted to the net for downloading
 by dozens of &quot;script kiddies&quot;. Such a tool might appear at any time
 from the announcement of the security hole to several months later.
 Once it appears, anyone with a browser and an attitude can break any
 system whose administrators have done nothing about the flaw.</P>
<P>Compared to those costs, cipher overheads are an insignificant factor
 in the cost of security.</P>
<P>The only thing using a weak cipher can do for you is to cause all
 your other investment to be wasted.</P>
<H2><A name="exlaw">Cryptography Export Laws</A></H2>
<P>Many nations restrict the export of cryptography and some restrict
 its use by their citizens or others within their borders.</P>
<H3><A name="USlaw">US Law</A></H3>
<P>US laws, as currently interpreted by the US government, forbid export
 of most cryptographic software from the US in machine-readable form
 without government permission. In general, the restrictions apply even
 if the software is widely-disseminated or public-domain and even if it
 came from outside the US originally. Cryptography is legally a munition
 and export is tightly controlled under the<A href="glossary.html#EAR">
 EAR</A> Export Administration Regulations.</P>
<P>If you are a US citizen, your brain is considered US territory no
 matter where it is physically located at the moment. The US believes
 that its laws apply to its citizens everywhere, not just within the US.
 Providing technical assistance or advice to foreign &quot;munitions&quot;
 projects is illegal. The US government has very little sense of humor
 about this issue and does not consider good intentions to be sufficient
 excuse. Beware.</P>
<P>The<A href="http://www.bxa.doc.gov/Encryption/"> official website</A>
 for these regulations is run by the Commerce Department's Bureau of
 Export Administration (BXA).</P>
<P>The<A href="http://www.eff.org/bernstein/"> Bernstein case</A>
 challenges the export restrictions on Constitutional grounds. Code is
 speech so restrictions on export of code violate the First Amendment's
 free speech provisions. This argument has succeeded in two levels of
 court so far. It is quite likely to go on to the Supreme Court.</P>
<P>The regulations were changed substantially in January 2000,
 apparently as a government attempt to get off the hook in the Bernstein
 case. It is now legal to export public domain source code for
 encryption, provided you notify the<A href="glossary.html#BXA"> BXA</A>
.</P>
<P>There are, however, still restrictions in force. Moreover, the
 regulations can still be changed again whenever the government chooses
 to do so. Short of a Supreme Court ruling (in the Berstein case or
 another) that overturns the regulations completely, the problem of
 export regulation is not likely to go away in the forseeable future.</P>
<H4><A name="UScontrib">US contributions to FreeS/WAN</A></H4>
<P>The FreeS/WAN project<STRONG> cannot accept software contributions,<EM>
 not even small bug fixes</EM>, from US citizens or residents</STRONG>.
 We want it to be absolutely clear that our distribution is not subject
 to US export law. Any contribution from an American might open that
 question to a debate we'd prefer to avoid. It might also put the
 contributor at serious legal risk.</P>
<P>Of course Americans can still make valuable contributions (many
 already have) by reporting bugs, or otherwise contributing to
 discussions, on the project<A href="mail.html"> mailing list</A>. Since
 the list is public, this is clearly constitutionally protected free
 speech.</P>
<P>Note, however, that the export laws restrict Americans from providing
 technical assistance to foreign &quot;munitions&quot; projects. The government
 might claim that private discussions or correspondence with FreeS/WAN
 developers were covered by this. It is not clear what the courts would
 do with such a claim, so we strongly encourage Americans to use the
 list rather than risk the complications.</P>

<H2><A name="desnotsecure">DES is Not Secure</A></H2>
<P>DES, the<STRONG> D</STRONG>ata<STRONG> E</STRONG>ncryption<STRONG> S</STRONG>
tandard, can no longer be considered secure. While no major flaws in its
 innards are known, it is fundamentally inadequate because its<STRONG>
 56-bit key is too short</STRONG>. It is vulnerable to<A href="glossary.html#brute">
 brute-force search</A> of the whole key space, either by large
 collections of general-purpose machines or even more quickly by
 specialized hardware. Of course this also applies to<STRONG> any other
 cipher with only a 56-bit key</STRONG>. The only reason anyone could
 have for using a 56 or 64-bit key is to comply with various<A href="exportlaw.html">
 export laws</A> intended to ensure the use of breakable ciphers.</P>
<P>Non-government cryptologists have been saying DES's 56-bit key was
 too short for some time -- some of them were saying it in the 70's when
 DES became a standard -- but the US government has consistently
 ridiculed such suggestions.</P>
<P>A group of well-known cryptographers looked at key lengths in a<A href="http://www.counterpane.com/keylength.html">
 1996 paper</A>. They suggested a<EM> minimum</EM> of 75 bits to
 consider an existing cipher secure and a<EM> minimum of 90 bits for new
 ciphers</EM>. More recent papers, covering both<A href="glossary.html#symmetric">
 symmetric</A> and<A href="glossary.html#public"> public key</A> systems
 are at<A href="http://www.cryptosavvy.com/"> cryptosavvy.com</A> and<A href="http://www.rsasecurity.com/rsalabs/bulletins/bulletin13.html">
 rsa.com</A>. For all algorithms, the minimum keylengths recommended in
 such papers are significantly longer than the maximums allowed by
 various export laws.</P>
<P>In a<A href="http://www.privacy.nb.ca/cryptography/archives/cryptography/html/1998-09/0095.html">
 1998 ruling</A>, a German court described DES as &quot;out-of-date and not
 safe enough&quot; and held a bank liable for using it.</P>
<H3><A name="deshware">Dedicated hardware breaks DES in a few days</A></H3>
<P>The question of DES security has now been settled once and for all.
 In early 1998, the<A href="http://www.eff.org/"> Electronic Frontier
 Foundation</A> built a<A href="http://www.eff.org/descracker.html">
 DES-cracking machine</A>. It can find a DES key in an average of a few
 days' search. The details of all this, including complete code listings
 and complete plans for the machine, have been published in<A href="biblio.html#EFF">
<CITE> Cracking DES</CITE></A>, by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.</P>
<P>That machine cost just over $200,000 to design and build. &quot;Moore's
 Law&quot; is that machines get faster (or cheaper, for the same speed) by
 roughly a factor of two every 18 months. At that rate, their $200,000
 in 1998 becomes $50,000 in 2001.</P>
<P>However, Moore's Law is not exact and the $50,000 estimate does not
 allow for the fact that a copy based on the published EFF design would
 cost far less than the original. We cannot say exactly what such a
 cracker would cost today, but it would likely be somewhere between
 $10,000 and $100,000.</P>
<P>A large corporation could build one of these out of petty cash. The
 cost is low enough for a senior manager to hide it in a departmental
 budget and avoid having to announce or justify the project. Any
 government agency, from a major municipal police force up, could afford
 one. Or any other group with a respectable budget -- criminal
 organisations, political groups, labour unions, religious groups, ...
 Or any millionaire with an obsession or a grudge, or just strange taste
 in toys.</P>
<P>One might wonder if a private security or detective agency would have
 one for rent. They wouldn't need many clients to pay off that
 investment.</P>
<H3><A name="spooks">Spooks may break DES faster yet</A></H3>
<P>As for the security and intelligence agencies of various nations,
 they may have had DES crackers for years, and theirs may be much
 faster. It is difficult to make most computer applications work well on
 parallel machines, or to design specialised hardware to accelerate
 them. Cipher-cracking is one of the very few exceptions. It is entirely
 straightforward to speed up cracking by just adding hardware. Within
 very broad limits, you can make it as fast as you like if you have the
 budget. The EFF's $200,000 machine breaks DES in a few days. An<A href="http://www.planepage.com/">
 aviation website</A> gives the cost of a B1 bomber as $200,000,000.
 Spending that much, an intelligence agency could break DES in an
 average time of<EM> six and a half minutes</EM>.</P>
<P>That estimate assumes they use the EFF's 1998 technology and just
 spend more money. They may have an attack that is superior to brute
 force, they quite likely have better chip technology (Moore's law, a
 bigger budget, and whatever secret advances they may have made) and of
 course they may have spent the price of an aircraft carrier, not just
 one aircraft.</P>
<P>In short, we have<EM> no idea</EM> how quickly these organisations
 can break DES. Unless they're spectacularly incompetent or horribly
 underfunded, they can certainly break it, but we cannot guess how
 quickly. Pick any time unit between days and milliseconds; none is
 entirely unbelievable. More to the point, none of them is of any
 comfort if you don't want such organisations reading your
 communications.</P>
<P>Note that this may be a concern even if nothing you do is a threat to
 anyone's national security. An intelligence agency might well consider
 it to be in their national interest for certain companies to do well.
 If you're competing against such companies in a world market and that
 agency can read your secrets, you have a serious problem.</P>
<P>One might wonder about technology the former Soviet Union and its
 allies developed for cracking DES during the Cold War. They must have
 tried; the cipher was an American standard and widely used. Certainly
 those countries have some fine mathematicians, and those agencies had
 budget. How well did they succeed? Is their technology now for sale or
 rent?</P>
<H3><A name="desnet">Networks break DES in a few weeks</A></H3>
<P>Before the definitive EFF effort, DES had been cracked several times
 by people using many machines. See this<A href="http://www.distributed.net/pressroom/DESII-1-PR.html">
 press release</A> for example.</P>
<P>A major corporation, university, or government department could break
 DES by using spare cycles on their existing collection of computers, by
 dedicating a group of otherwise surplus machines to the problem, or by
 combining the two approaches. It might take them weeks or months,
 rather than the days required for the EFF machine, but they could do
 it.</P>
<P>What about someone working alone, without the resources of a large
 organisation? For them, cracking DES will not be easy, but it may be
 possible. A few thousand dollars buys a lot of surplus workstations. A
 pile of such machines will certainly heat your garage nicely and might
 break DES in a few months or years. Or enroll at a university and use
 their machines. Or use an employer's machines. Or crack security
 somewhere and steal the resources to crack a DES key. Or write a virus
 that steals small amounts of resources on many machines. Or . . .</P>
<P>None of these approaches are easy or break DES really quickly, but an
 attacker only needs to find one that is feasible and breaks DES quickly
 enough to be dangerous. How much would you care to bet that this will
 be impossible if the attacker is clever and determined? How valuable is
 your data? Are you authorised to risk it on a dubious bet?</P>
<H3><A name="no_des">We disable DES</A></H3>
<P>In short, it is now absolutely clear that<STRONG> DES is not secure</STRONG>
 against</P>
<UL>
<LI>any<STRONG> well-funded opponent</STRONG></LI>
<LI>any opponent (even a penniless one) with access (even stolen access)
 to<STRONG> enough general purpose computers</STRONG></LI>
</UL>
<P>That is why<STRONG> Linux FreeS/WAN disables all transforms which use
 plain DES</STRONG> for encryption.</P>
<P>DES is in the source code, because we need DES to implement our
 default encryption transform,<A href="glossary.html#3DES"> Triple DES</A>
.<STRONG> We urge you not to use single DES</STRONG>. We do not provide
 any easy way to enable it in FreeS/WAN, and our policy is to provide no
 assistance to anyone wanting to do so.</P>
<H3><A name="40joke">40-bits is laughably weak</A></H3>
<P>The same is true, in spades, of ciphers -- DES or others -- crippled
 by 40-bit keys, as many ciphers were required to be until recently
 under various<A href="#exlaw"> export laws</A>. A brute force search of
 such a cipher's keyspace is 2<SUP>16</SUP> times faster than a similar
 search against DES. The EFF's machine can do a brute-force search of a
 40-bit key space in<EM> seconds</EM>. One contest to crack a 40-bit
 cipher was won by a student<A href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/18.80.html#subj1">
 using a few hundred idle machines at his university</A>. It took only
 three and half hours.</P>
<P>We do not, and will not, implement any 40-bit cipher.</P>
<H3><A name="altdes">Triple DES is almost certainly secure</A></H3>
<P><A href="glossary.html#3DES">Triple DES</A>, usually abbreviated

 It's only major flaw is that the small keyspace allows brute force
 attacks to succeeed. Triple DES enlarges the key space to 168 bits,
 making brute-force search a ridiculous impossibility.</P>
<P>3DES is currently the only block cipher implemented in FreeS/WAN.
 3DES is, unfortunately, about 1/3 the speed of DES, but modern CPUs

<PRE>        Strong Internet Privacy Software Free for Linux Users Worldwide

Toronto, ON, April 14, 1999 - 

The Linux FreeS/WAN project today released free software to protect
the privacy of Internet communications using strong encryption codes.
FreeS/WAN automatically encrypts data as it crosses the Internet, to
prevent unauthorized people from receiving or modifying it.  One
ordinary PC per site runs this free software under Linux to become a
secure gateway in a Virtual Private Network, without having to modify
users' operating systems or application software.  The project built
and released the software outside the United States, avoiding US
government regulations which prohibit good privacy protection.
FreeS/WAN version 1.0 is available immediately for downloading at
http://www.xs4all.nl/~freeswan/.

&quot;Today's FreeS/WAN release allows network administrators to build
excellent secure gateways out of old PCs at no cost, or using a cheap
new PC,&quot; said John Gilmore, the entrepreneur who instigated the
project in 1996.  &quot;They can build operational experience with strong
network encryption and protect their users' most important
communications worldwide.&quot;

&quot;The software was written outside the United States, and we do not
accept contributions from US citizens or residents, so that it can be
freely published for use in every country,&quot; said Henry Spencer, who
built the release in Toronto, Canada.  &quot;Similar products based in the
US require hard-to-get government export licenses before they can be
provided to non-US users, and can never be simply published on a Web
site.  Our product is freely available worldwide for immediate
downloading, at no cost.&quot;

FreeS/WAN provides privacy against both quiet eavesdropping (such as
&quot;packet sniffing&quot;) and active attempts to compromise communications
(such as impersonating participating computers).  Secure &quot;tunnels&quot; carry
information safely across the Internet between locations such as a
company's main office, distant sales offices, and roaming laptops.  This
protects the privacy and integrity of all information sent among those
locations, including sensitive intra-company email, financial transactions
such as mergers and acquisitions, business negotiations, personal medical
records, privileged correspondence with lawyers, and information about
crimes or civil rights violations.  The software will be particularly
useful to frequent wiretapping targets such as private companies competing
with government-owned companies, civil rights groups and lawyers,
opposition political parties, and dissidents. 

FreeS/WAN provides privacy for Internet packets using the proposed
standard Internet Protocol Security (IPSEC) protocols.  FreeS/WAN
negotiates strong keys using Diffie-Hellman key agreement with 1024-bit
keys, and encrypts each packet with 168-bit Triple-DES (3DES).  A modern
$500 PC can set up a tunnel in less than a second, and can encrypt
6 megabits of packets per second, easily handling the whole available
bandwidth at the vast majority of Internet sites.  In preliminary testing,
FreeS/WAN interoperated with 3DES IPSEC products from OpenBSD, PGP, SSH,
Cisco, Raptor, and Xedia.  Since FreeS/WAN is distributed as source code,
its innards are open to review by outside experts and sophisticated users,
reducing the chance of undetected bugs or hidden security compromises.

The software has been in development for several years.  It has been
funded by several philanthropists interested in increased privacy on
the Internet, including John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic
Frontier Foundation, a leading online civil rights group.
