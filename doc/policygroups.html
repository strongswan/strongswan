<H1><A NAME="4">How to Configure Linux FreeS/WAN with Policy Groups</A></H1>
<A NAME="policygroups"></A>
<H2><A NAME="4_1">What are Policy Groups?</A></H2>
<P><STRONG>Policy Groups</STRONG> are an elegant general mechanism to
 configure FreeS/WAN. They are useful for many FreeS/WAN users.</P>
<P>In previous FreeS/WAN versions, you needed to configure each IPsec
 connection explicitly, on both local and remote hosts. This could
 become complex.</P>
<P>By contrast, Policy Groups allow you to set local IPsec policy for
 lists of remote hosts and networks, simply by listing the hosts and
 networks which you wish to have special treatment in one of several
 Policy Group files. FreeS/WAN then internally creates the connections
 needed to implement each policy.</P>
<P>In the next section we describe our five Base Policy Groups, which
 you can use to configure IPsec in many useful ways. Later, we will show
 you how to create an IPsec VPN using one line of configuration for each
 remote host or network.</P>
<A NAME="builtin_policygroups"></A>
<H3><A NAME="4_1_1">Built-In Security Options</A></H3>
<P>FreeS/WAN offers these Base Policy Groups:</P>
<DL>
<DT>private</DT>
<DD> FreeS/WAN only communicates privately with the listed<A HREF="glossary.html#CIDR">
 CIDR</A> blocks. If needed, FreeS/WAN attempts to create a connection
 opportunistically. If this fails, FreeS/WAN blocks communication.
 Inbound blocking is assumed to be done by the firewall. FreeS/WAN
 offers firewall hooks but no modern firewall rules to help with inbound
 blocking.</DD>
<DT>private-or-clear</DT>
<DD> FreeS/WAN prefers private communication with the listed CIDR
 blocks. If needed, FreeS/WAN attempts to create a connection
 opportunistically. If this fails, FreeS/WAN allows traffic in the
 clear.</DD>
<DT>clear-or-private</DT>
<DD> FreeS/WAN communicates cleartext with the listed CIDR blocks, but
 also accepts inbound OE connection requests from them. Also known as<A HREF="glossary.html#passive.OE">
 passive OE (pOE)</A>, this policy may be used to create an<A HREF="glossary.html#responder">
 opportunistic responder</A>.</DD>
<DT>clear</DT>
<DD> FreeS/WAN only communicates cleartext with the listed CIDR blocks.</DD>
<DT>block</DT>
<DD>FreeS/WAN blocks traffic to and from and the listed CIDR blocks.
 Inbound blocking is assumed to be done by the firewall. FreeS/WAN
 offers firewall hooks but no modern firewall rules to help with inbound
 blocking.
<!-- also called "blockdrop".-->

<A NAME="policy.group.notes"></A>
<P>Notes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Base Policy Groups apply to communication with this host only.</LI>
<LI>The most specific rule (whether policy or pre-configured connection)
 applies. This has several practical applications:
<UL>
<LI>If CIDR blocks overlap, FreeS/WAN chooses the most specific
 applicable block.</LI>
<LI>This decision also takes into account any pre-configured connections
 you may have.</LI>
<LI>If the most specific connection is a pre-configured connection, the
 following procedure applies. If that connection is up, it will be used.
 If it is routed, it will be brought up. If it is added, no action will
 be taken.</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI>Base Policy Groups are created using built-in connections. Details
 in<A HREF="manpage.d/ipsec.conf.5.html"> man ipsec.conf</A>.</LI>
<LI>All Policy Groups are bidirectional.<A HREF="src/policy-groups-table.html">
 This chart</A> shows some technical details. FreeS/WAN does not support
 one-way encryption, since it can give users a false sense of security.</LI>
</UL>
<H2><A NAME="4_2">Using Policy Groups</A></H2>
<P>The Base Policy Groups which build IPsec connections rely on
 Opportunistic Encryption. To use the following examples, you must first
 become OE-capable, as described in our<A HREF="quickstart.html#quickstart">
 quickstart guide</A>.<A NAME="example1"></A></P>
<H3><A NAME="4_2_1">Example 1: Using a Base Policy Group</A></H3>
<P>Simply place CIDR blocks (<A HREF="#dnswarning">names</A>, IPs or IP
 ranges) in /etc/ipsec.d/policies/<VAR>[groupname]</VAR>, and reread the
 policy group files.</P>
<P>For example, the<VAR> private-or-clear</VAR> policy tells FreeS/WAN
 to prefer encrypted communication to the listed CIDR blocks. Failing
 that, it allows talk in the clear.</P>
<P>To make this your default policy, place<A HREF="glossary.html#fullnet">
 fullnet</A> in the<VAR> private-or-clear</VAR> policy group file:</P>
<PRE>    [root@xy root]# cat /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear
    # This file defines the set of CIDRs (network/mask-length) to which
    # communication should be private, if possible, but in the clear otherwise.
    ....
    0.0.0.0/0</PRE>
<P>and reload your policies with</P>
<PRE>    ipsec auto --rereadgroups</PRE>
<P>Use<A HREF="quickstart.html#opp.test"> this test</A> to verify
 opportunistic connections.</P>
<A NAME="example2"></A>
<H3><A NAME="4_2_2">Example 2: Defining IPsec Security Policy with
 Groups</A></H3>
<P>Defining IPsec security policy with Base Policy Groups is like
 creating a shopping list: just put CIDR blocks in the appropriate group
 files. For example:</P>
<PRE>    [root@xy root]# cd /etc/ipsec.d/policies
    [root@xy policies]# cat private
        192.0.2.96/27              # The finance department
        192.0.2.192/29             # HR
	192.0.2.12                 # HR gateway
        irc.private.example.com    # Private IRC server
  
    [root@xy policies]# cat private-or-clear
        0.0.0.0/0                  # My default policy: try to encrypt.

    [root@xy policies]# cat clear
        192.0.2.18/32              # My POP3 server
        192.0.2.19/32              # My Web proxy

    [root@xy policies]# cat block
        spamsource.example.com</PRE>
<P>To make these settings take effect, type:</P>
<PRE>    ipsec auto --rereadgroups</PRE>
<P>Notes:</P>
<UL>
<LI>For opportunistic connection attempts to succeed, all participating
 FreeS/WAN hosts and gateways must be configured for OE.</LI>
<LI>Examples 3 through 5 show how to implement a detailed<VAR> private</VAR>
 policy.</LI>
<LI><A NAME="dnswarning"></A><FONT COLOR="RED"> Warning:</FONT> Using
 DNS names in policy files and ipsec.conf can be tricky. If the name
 does not resolve, the policy will not be implemented for that name. It
 is therefore safer either to use IPs, or to put any critical names in
 /etc/hosts. We plan to implement periodic DNS retry to help with this.
<BR> Names are resolved at FreeS/WAN startup, or when the policies are
 reloaded. Unfortunately, name lookup can hold up the startup process.
 If you have fast DNS servers, the problem may be less severe.</LI>

<H3><A NAME="4_2_3">Example 3: Creating a Simple IPsec VPN with the<VAR>
 private</VAR> Group</A></H3>
<P>You can create an IPsec VPN between several hosts, with only one line
 of configuration per host, using the<VAR> private</VAR> policy group.</P>
<P>First, use our<A HREF="quickstart.html"> quickstart guide</A> to set
 up each participating host with a FreeS/WAN install and OE.</P>
<P>In one host's<VAR> /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private</VAR>, list the
 peers to which you wish to protect traffic. For example:</P>
<PRE>    [root@xy root]# cd /etc/ipsec.d/policies
    [root@xy policies]# cat private
        192.0.2.9              # several hosts at example.com
        192.0.2.11             
        192.0.2.12                 
        irc.private.example.com 
</PRE>
<P>Copy the<VAR> private</VAR> file to each host. Remove the local host,
 and add the initial host.</P>
<PRE>    scp2 /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private root@192.0.2.12:/etc/ipsec.d/policies/private</PRE>
<P>On each host, reread the policy groups with</P>
<PRE>    ipsec auto --rereadgroups</PRE>
<P>That's it! You're configured.</P>
<P>Test by pinging between two hosts. After a second or two, traffic
 should flow, and</P>
<PRE>    ipsec eroute</PRE>
<P>should yield something like</P>
<PRE>    192.0.2.11/32   -&gt; 192.0.2.8/32  =&gt; tun0x149f@192.0.2.8</PRE>
<P>where your host IPs are substituted for 192.0.2.11 and 192.0.2.8.</P>
<P>If traffic does not flow, there may be an error in your OE setup.
 Revisit our<A HREF="quickstart.html"> quickstart guide</A>.</P>
<P>Our next two examples show you how to add subnets to this IPsec VPN.</P>
<A NAME="example4"></A>
<H3><A NAME="4_2_4">Example 4: New Policy Groups to Protect a Subnet</A></H3>
<P>To protect traffic to a subnet behind your FreeS/WAN gateway, you'll
 need additional DNS records, and new policy groups. To set up the DNS,
 see our<A HREF="quickstart.html#opp.gate"> quickstart guide</A>. To
 create five new policy groups for your subnet, copy these connections
 to<VAR> /etc/ipsec.conf</VAR>. Substitute your subnet's IPs for
 192.0.2.128/29.</P>
<PRE>
conn private-net
    also=private  # inherits settings (eg. auto=start) from built in conn
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29  # your subnet's IPs here

conn private-or-clear-net
    also=private-or-clear
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29

conn clear-or-private-net
    also=clear-or-private
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29

conn block-net
    also=block
    leftsubnet=192.0.2.128/29
</PRE>
<P>Copy the gateway's files to serve as the initial policy group files
 for the new groups:</P>
<PRE>
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-net
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear /etc/ipsec.d/policies/private-or-clear-net
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear-or-private /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear-or-private-net
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear /etc/ipsec.d/policies/clear-net
    cp -p /etc/ipsec.d/policies/block /etc/ipsec.d/policies/block
</PRE>
<P><STRONG>Tip: Since a missing policy group file is equivalent to a
 file with no entries, you need only create files for the connections
 you'll use.</STRONG></P>
<P>To test one of your new groups, place the fullnet 0.0.0.0/0 in<VAR>
 private-or-clear-net</VAR>. Perform the subnet test in<A HREF="quickstart.html#opp.test">
 our quickstart guide</A>. You should see a connection, and</P>
<PRE>    ipsec eroute</PRE>
<P>should include an entry which mentions the subnet node's IP and the
 OE test site IP, like this:</P>
<PRE>    192.0.2.131/32   -&gt; 192.139.46.77/32  =&gt; tun0x149f@192.0.2.11</PRE>
<A HREF="example5"></A>
<H3><A NAME="4_2_5">Example 5: Adding a Subnet to the VPN</A></H3>
<P>Suppose you wish to secure traffic to a subnet 192.0.2.192/29 behind
 a FreeS/WAN box 192.0.2.12.</P>
<P>First, add DNS entries to configure 192.0.2.12 as an opportunistic
 gateway for that subnet. Instructions are in our<A HREF="quickstart.html#opp.gate">
 quickstart guide</A>. Next, create a<VAR> private-net</VAR> group on
 192.0.2.12 as described in<A HREF="#example4"> Example 4</A>.</P>
<P>On each other host, add the subnet 192.0.2.192/29 to<VAR> private</VAR>
, yielding for example</P>
<PRE>    [root@xy root]# cd /etc/ipsec.d/policies
    [root@xy policies]# cat private
        192.0.2.9              # several hosts at example.com

        192.0.2.12             # HR department gateway
        192.0.2.192/29         # HR subnet
        irc.private.example.com
</PRE>
<P>and reread policy groups with</P>
<PRE>    ipsec auto --rereadgroups</PRE>
<P>That's all the configuration you need.</P>
<P>Test your VPN by pinging from a machine on 192.0.2.192/29 to any
