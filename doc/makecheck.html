<H2><A NAME="38_1">What is &quot;make check&quot;</A></H2>
<P> &quot;make check&quot; is a target in the top level makefile. It takes care of
 running a number of unit and system tests to confirm that FreeSWAN has
 been compiled correctly, and that no new bugs have been introduced.</P>
<P> As FreeSWAN contains both kernel and userspace components, doing
 testing of FreeSWAN requires that the kernel be simulated. This is
 typically difficult to do as a kernel requires that it be run on bare
 hardware. A technology has emerged that makes this simpler. This is<A HREF="http://user-mode-linux.sourceforge.net">
 User Mode Linux</A>.</P>
<P> User-Mode Linux is a way to build a Linux kernel such that it can
 run as a process under another Linux (or in the future other) kernel.
 Presently, this can only be done for 2.4 guest kernels. The host kernel
 can be 2.2 or 2.4.</P>
<P> &quot;make check&quot; expects to be able to build User-Mode Linux kernels
 with FreeSWAN included. To do this it needs to have some files
 downloaded and extracted prior to running &quot;make check&quot;. This is
 described in the<A HREF="umltesting.html"> UML testing</A> document.</P>
<P> After having run the example in the UML testing document and
 successfully brought up the four machine combination, you are ready to
 use &quot;make check&quot;</P>
<H2><A NAME="38_2">Running &quot;make check&quot;</A></H2>
<P> &quot;make check&quot; works by walking the FreeSWAN source tree invoking the
 &quot;check&quot; target at each node. At present there are tests defined only
 for the <CODE>klips</CODE> directory. These tests will use the UML
 infrastructure to test out pieces of the <CODE>klips</CODE> code.</P>
<P> The results of the tests can be recorded. If the environment
 variable <CODE>$REGRESSRESULTS</CODE> is non-null, then the results of
 each test will be recorded. This can be used as part of a nightly
 regression testing system, see<A HREF="nightly.html"> Nightly testing</A>
 for more details.</P>
<P> &quot;make check&quot; otherwise prints a minimal amount of output for each
 test, and indicates pass/fail status of each test as they are run.
 Failed tests do not cause failure of the target in the form of exit
 codes.</P>
<H1><A NAME="39">How to write a &quot;make check&quot; test</A></H1>
<H2><A NAME="39_1">Structure of a test</A></H2>
<P> Each test consists of a set of directories under <CODE>testing/</CODE>
. There are directories for <CODE>klips</CODE>, <CODE>pluto</CODE>, <CODE>
packaging</CODE> and <CODE>libraries</CODE>. Each directory has a list
 of tests to run is stored in a file called <CODE>TESTLIST</CODE> in
 that directory. e.g. <CODE>testing/klips/TESTLIST</CODE>.</P>
<H2 NAME="TESTLIST"><A NAME="39_2">The TESTLIST</A></H2>
<P> This isn't actually a shell script. It just looks like one. Some
 tools other than /bin/sh process it. Lines that start with # are
 comments.</P>
<PRE>

<P>The first word provides the test type, detailed below.</P>
<P> The second word is the name of the test to run. This the directory

</DL>
 Tests marked (TBD) have yet to be fully defined.
<P> Each test directory has a file in it called <CODE>testparams.sh</CODE>
. This file sets a number of environment variables to define the
 parameters of the test.</P>
<H2><A NAME="39_4">Common parameters</A></H2>
<DL>
<DT>TESTNAME</DT>
<DD>the name of the test (repeated for checking purposes)</DD>
<DT>TEST_TYPE</DT>
<DD>the type of the test (repeat of type type above)</DD>
<DT>TESTHOST</DT>
<DD>the name of the UML machine to run for the test, typically &quot;east&quot; or
 &quot;west&quot;</DD>
<DT>TEST_PURPOSE</DT>
<DD>The purpose of the test is one of:
<DL>
<DT>goal</DT>
<DD>The goal purpose is where a test is defined for code that is not yet
 finished. The test indicates when the goals have in fact been reached.</DD>
<DT>regress</DT>
<DD>This is a test to determine that a previously existing bug has been
 repaired. This test will initially be created to reproduce the bug in
 isolation, and then the bug will be fixed.</DD>
<DT>exploit</DT>
<DD>This is a set of packets/programs that causes a vulnerability to be
 exposed. It is a specific variation of the regress option.</DD>
</DL>
</DD>
<DT>TEST_GOAL_ITEM</DT>
<DT></DT>
<DD>in the case of a goal test, this is a reference to the requirements
 document</DD>
<DT>TEST_PROB_REPORT</DT>
<DD>in the case of regression test, this the problem report number from
 GNATS</DD>
<DT>TEST_EXPLOIT_URL</DT>
<DD>in the case of an exploit, this is a URL referencing the paper
 explaining the origin of the test and the origin of exploit software</DD>
<DT>REF_CONSOLE_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>a file in the test directory that contains the sanitized console
 output against which to compare the output of the actual test.</DD>
<DT>REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS</DT>
<DD>a list of scripts (found in <CODE>klips/test/fixups</CODE>) to apply
 to sanitize the console output of the machine under test. These are
 typically perl, awk or sed scripts that remove things in the kernel
 output that change each time the test is run and/or compiled.</DD>
<DT>INIT_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD>
<P>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console in
 single user mode prior to starting the tests. This file will usually
 set up any eroute's and SADB entries that are required for the test.</P>
<P>Lines beginning with # are skipped. Blank lines are skipped.
 Otherwise, a shell prompted is waited for each time (consisting of <CODE>
\n#</CODE>) and then the command is sent. Note that the prompt is waited
 for before the command and not after, so completion of the last command
 in the script is not required. This is often used to invoke a program
 to monitor the system, e.g. <CODE>ipsec pf_key</CODE>.</P>
</DD>
<DT>RUN_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD>
<P>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console in
 single user mode, before the packets are sent. On single machine tests,
 this script doesn't provide any more power than INIT_SCRIPT, but is
 implemented for consistency's sake.</P>
</DD>
<DT>FINAL_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD>
<P>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console in
 single user mode after the final packet is sent. Similar to
 INIT_SCRIPT, above. If not specified, then the single command &quot;halt&quot; is
 sent. If specified, then the script should end with a halt command to
 nicely shutdown the UML.</P>
</DD>
<DT>CONSOLEDIFFDEBUG</DT>
<DD>If set to &quot;true&quot; then the series of console fixups (see
 REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS) will be output after it is constructed. (It should
 be set to &quot;false&quot;, or unset otherwise)</DD>
<DT>NETJIGDEBUG</DT>
<DD>If set to &quot;true&quot; then the series of console fixups (see
 REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS) will be output after it is constructed. (It should
 be set to &quot;false&quot;, or unset otherwise)</DD>
<DT>NETJIGTESTDEBUG</DT>
<DD> If set to &quot;netjig&quot;, then the results of talking to the <CODE>
uml_netjig</CODE> will be printed to stderr during the test. In
 addition, the jig will be invoked with --debug, which causes it to log
 its process ID, and wait 60 seconds before continuing. This can be used
 if you are trying to debug the <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE> program itself.</DD>
<DT>HOSTTESTDEBUG</DT>
<DD> If set to &quot;hosttest&quot;, then the results of taling to the consoles of
 the UMLs will be printed to stderr during the test.</DD>
<DT>NETJIGWAITUSER</DT>
<DD> If set to &quot;waituser&quot;, then the scripts will wait forever for user
 input before they shut the tests down. Use this is if you are debugging
 through the kernel.</DD>
<DT>PACKETRATE</DT>
<DD> A number, in miliseconds (default is 500ms) at which packets will
 be replayed by the netjig.</DD>
</DL>
<H2><A NAME="39_5">KLIPStest paramaters</A></H2>
<P> The klipstest function starts a program (<CODE>
testing/utils/uml_netjig/uml_netjig</CODE>) to setup a bunch of I/O
 sockets (that simulate network interfaces). It then exports the
 references to these sockets to the environment and invokes (using
 system()) a given script. It waits for the script to finish.</P>

<!-- <IMG SRC="single_netjig.png" ALT="block diagram of uml_netjig"> -->
<P> The script invoked (<CODE>testing/utils/host-test.tcl</CODE>) is a
 TCL<A HREF="http://expect.nist.gov/"> expect</A> script that arranges
 to start the UML and configure it appropriately for the test. The
 configuration is done with the script given above for<VAR> INIT_SCRIPT</VAR>
. The TCL script then forks, leaves the UML in the background and exits.
 uml_netjig continues. It then starts listening to the simulated network
 answering ARPs and inserting packets as appropriate.</P>
<P> The klipstest function invokes <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE> with
 arguments to capture output from network interface(s) and insert
 packets as appropriate:</P>
<DL>
<DT>PUB_INPUT</DT>
<DD>a<A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/"> pcap</A> file to feed in on the
 public (encrypted) interface. (typically, eth1)</DD>
<DT>PRIV_INPUT</DT>
<DD>a pcap file to feed in on the private (plain-text) interface
 (typically, eth0).</DD>
<DT>REF_PUB_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the public (eth1)
 interface are captured to a<A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/"> pcap</A>
 file by <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE>. The klipstest function then uses
 tcpdump on the file to produce text output, which is compared to the
 file given.</DD>
<DT>REF_PUB_FILTER</DT>
<DD>a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
 processing. Defaults to &quot;cat&quot;.</DD>
<DT>REF_PRIV_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the private (eth0)
 interface are captured and compared after conversion by tcpdump, as
 with<VAR> REFPUBOUTPUT</VAR>.</DD>
<DT>REF_PRIV_FILTER</DT>
<DD>a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
 processing. Defaults to &quot;cat&quot;.</DD>
<DT>EXITONEMPTY</DT>
<DD>a flag for <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE>. It should contain
 &quot;--exitonempty&quot; of uml_netjig should exit when all of the input (<VAR>
PUBINPUT</VAR>,<VAR>PRIVINPUT</VAR>) packets have been injected.</DD>
<DT>ARPREPLY</DT>
<DD>a flag for <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE>. It should contain &quot;--arpreply&quot;
 if <CODE>uml_netjig</CODE> should reply to ARP requests. One will
 typically set this to avoid having to fudge the ARP cache manually.</DD>
<DT>TCPDUMPFLAGS</DT>
<DD>a set of flags for the tcpdump used when converting captured output.
 Typical values will include &quot;-n&quot; to turn off DNS, and often &quot;-E&quot; to set
 the decryption key (tcpdump 3.7.1 and higher only) for ESP packets. The
 &quot;-t&quot; flag (turn off timestamps) is provided automatically</DD>
<DT>NETJIG_EXTRA</DT>
<DD>additional comments to be sent to the netjig. This may arrange to
 record or create additional networks, or may toggle options.</DD>
</DL>
<H2><A NAME="39_6">mkinsttest paramaters</A></H2>
<P> The basic concept of the <CODE>mkinsttest</CODE> test type is that
 it performs a &quot;make install&quot; to a temporary $DESTDIR. The resulting
 tree can then be examined to determine if it was done properly. The
 files can be uninstalled to determine if the file list was correct, or
 the contents of files can be examined more precisely.</P>
<DL>
<DT>INSTALL_FLAGS</DT>
<DD>If set, then an install will be done. This provides the set of flags
 to provide for the install. The target to be used (usually &quot;install&quot;)
 must be among the flags.</DD>
<DT>POSTINSTALL_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD>If set, a script to run after initial &quot;make install&quot;. Two arguments
 are provided: an absolute path to the root of the FreeSWAN src tree,
 and an absolute path to the temporary installation area.</DD>
<DT>INSTALL2_FLAGS</DT>
<DD>If set, a second install will be done using these flags. Similarly
 to INSTALL_FLAGS, the target must be among the flags.</DD>
<DT>UNINSTALL_FLAGS</DT>
<DD>If set, an uninstall will be done using these flags. Similarly to
 INSTALL_FLAGS, the target (usually &quot;uninstall&quot;) must be among the
 flags.</DD>
<DT>REF_FIND_f_l_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>If set, a <CODE>find $ROOT ( -type f -or -type -l )</CODE> will be
 done to get a list of a real files and symlinks. The resulting file
 will be compared to the file listed by this option.</DD>
<DT>REF_FILE_CONTENTS</DT>
<DD>If set, it should point to a file containing records for the form:
<PRE>
  
<!--VARIABLE-->
reffile</(null)>   
<!--VARIABLE-->
samplefile</(null)>
</PRE>
 one record per line. A diff between the provided reference file, and
 the sample file (located in the temporary installation root) will be
 done for each record.</DD>
</DL>
<H2><A NAME="39_7">rpm_build_install_test paramaters</A></H2>
<P> The <CODE>rpm_build_install_test</CODE> type is to verify that the
 proper packing list is produced by &quot;make rpm&quot;, and that the mechanisms
 for building the kernel modules produce consistent results.</P>
<DL>
<DT>RPM_KERNEL_SOURCE</DT>
<DD>Point to an extracted copy of the RedHat kernel source code.
 Variables from the environment may be used.</DD>
<DT>REF_RPM_CONTENTS</DT>
<DD>This is a file containing one record per line. Each record consists
 of a RPM name (may contain wildcards) and a filename to compare the
 contents to. The RPM will be located and a file list will be produced
 with rpm2cpio.</DD>
</DL>
<H2><A NAME="39_8">libtest paramaters</A></H2>
<P> The libtest test is for testing library routines. The library file
 is expected to provided an <CODE>#ifdef</CODE> by the name of<VAR>
 library</VAR>
<!--CODE_MAIN</CODE-->
. The libtest type invokes the C compiler to compile this
 file, links it against <CODE>libfreeswan.a</CODE> (to resolve any other
 dependancies) and runs the test with the <CODE>-r</CODE> argument to
 invoke a regression test.</(null)></P>
<P>The library test case is expected to do a self-test, exiting with
 status code 0 if everything is okay, and with non-zero otherwise. A
 core dump (exit code greater than 128) is noted specifically.</P>
<P> Unlike other tests, there are no subdirectories required, or other
 parameters to set.</P>
<H2 NAME="umlplutotest"><A NAME="39_9">umlplutotest paramaters</A></H2>
<P> The umlplutotest function starts a pair of user mode line processes.
 This is a 2-host version of umlXhost. The &quot;EAST&quot; and &quot;WEST&quot; slots are
 defined.</P>
<H2 NAME="umlXhost"><A NAME="39_10">umlXhost parameters</A></H2>
<P> The umlXtest function starts an arbitrary number of user mode line
 processes.</P>

<!-- <IMG SRC="single_netjig.png" ALT="block diagram of uml_netjig"> -->
<P> The script invoked (<CODE>testing/utils/Xhost-test.tcl</CODE>) is a
 TCL<A HREF="http://expect.nist.gov/"> expect</A> script that arranges
 to start each UML and configure it appropriately for the test. It then
 starts listening (using uml_netjig) to the simulated network answering
 ARPs and inserting packets as appropriate.</P>
<P> umlXtest has a series of slots, each of which should be filled by a
 host. The list of slots is controlled by the variable, XHOST_LIST. This
 variable should be set to a space seperated list of slots. The former
 umlplutotest is now implemented as a variation of the umlXhost test,
 with XHOST_LIST=&quot;EAST WEST&quot;.</P>
<P> For each host slot that is defined, a series of variables should be
 filled in, defining what configuration scripts to use for that host.</P>
<P> The following are used to control the console input and output to
 the system. Where the string ${host} is present, the host slot should
 be filled in. I.e. for the two host system with XHOST_LIST=&quot;EAST WEST&quot;,
 then the variables: EAST_INIT_SCRIPT and WEST_INIT_SCRIPT will exist.</P>
<DL>
<DT>${host}HOST</DT>
<DD>The name of the UML host which will fill this slot</DD>
<DT>${host}_INIT_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD>
<P>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console in
 single user mode prior to starting the tests. This file will usually
 set up any eroute's and SADB entries that are required for the test.
 Similar to INIT_SCRIPT, above.</P>
</DD>
<DT>${host}_RUN_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD>
<P>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console in
 single user mode, before the packets are sent. This set of commands is
 run after all of the virtual machines are initialized. I.e. after
 EAST_INIT_SCRIPT<B> AND</B> WEST_INIT_SCRIPT. This script can therefore
 do things that require that all machines are properly configured.</P>
</DD>
<DT>${host}_RUN2_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD>
<P>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console in
 single user mode, after the packets are sent. This set of commands is
 run before any of the virtual machines have been shut down. (I.e.
 before EAST_FINAL_SCRIPT<B> AND</B> WEST_FINAL_SCRIPT.) This script can
 therefore catch post-activity status reports.</P>
</DD>
<DT>${host}_FINAL_SCRIPT</DT>
<DD>
<P>a file of commands that is fed into the virtual machine's console in
 single user mode after the final packet is sent. Similar to
 INIT_SCRIPT, above. If not specified, then the single command &quot;halt&quot; is
 sent. Note that when this script is run, the other virtual machines may
 already have been killed. If specified, then the script should end with
 a halt command to nicely shutdown the UML.</P>
</DD>
<DT>REF_${host}_CONSOLE_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>Similar to REF_CONSOLE_OUTPUT, above.</DD>
</DL>
<P>Some additional flags apply to all hosts:</P>
<DL>
<DT>REF_CONSOLE_FIXUPS</DT>
<DD>a list of scripts (found in <CODE>klips/test/fixups</CODE>) to apply
 to sanitize the console output of the machine under test. These are
 typically perl, awk or sed scripts that remove things in the kernel
 output that change each time the test is run and/or compiled.</DD>
</DL>
<P> In addition to input to the console, the networks may have input fed
 to them:</P>
<DL>
<DT>EAST_INPUT/WEST_INPUT</DT>
<DD>a<A HREF="http://www.tcpdump.org/"> pcap</A> file to feed in on the
 private network side of each network. The &quot;EAST&quot; and &quot;WEST&quot; here refer
 to the networks, not the hosts.</DD>
<DT>REF_PUB_FILTER</DT>
<DD>a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
 processing. Defaults to &quot;cat&quot;.</DD>
<DT>REF_EAST_FILTER/REF_WEST_FILTER</DT>
<DD>a program that will filter the TCPDUMP output to do further
 processing. Defaults to &quot;cat&quot;.</DD>
&lt;
<DT>TCPDUMPFLAGS</DT>
<DD>a set of flags for the tcpdump used when converting captured output.
 Typical values will include &quot;-n&quot; to turn off DNS, and often &quot;-E&quot; to set
 the decryption key (tcpdump 3.7.1 and higher only) for ESP packets. The
 &quot;-t&quot; flag (turn off timestamps) is provided automatically</DD>
<DT>REF_EAST_OUTPUT/REF_WEST_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>a text file containing tcpdump output. Packets on the private (eth0)
 interface are captured and compared after conversion by tcpdump, as
 with<VAR> REF_PUB_OUTPUT</VAR>.</DD>
<P> There are two additional environment variables that may be set on
 the command line:</P>
<DL>
<DT> NETJIGVERBOSE=verbose export NETJIGVERBOSE</DT>
<DD> If set, then the test output will be &quot;chatty&quot;, and let you know
 what commands it is running, and as packets are sent. Without it set,
 the output is limited to success/failure messages.</DD>
<DT> NETJIGTESTDEBUG=netjig export NETJIGTESTDEBUG</DT>
<DD> This will enable debugging of the communication with uml_netjig,
 and turn on debugging in this utility. This does not imply
 NETJIGVERBOSE.</DD>
</DL>
<DT> HOSTTESTDEBUG=hosttest export HOSTTESTDEBUG</DT>
<DD> This will show all interactions with the user-mode-linux consoles</DD>
</DL>
<H2 NAME="kernelpatch"><A NAME="39_11">kernel_patch_test paramaters</A></H2>
<P> The kernel_patch_test function takes some kernel source, copies it
 with lndir, and then applies the patch as produced by &quot;make
 kernelpatch&quot;.</P>
<P> The following are used to control the input and output to the
 system:</P>
<DL>
<DT>KERNEL_NAME</DT>
<DD>the kernel name, typically something like &quot;linus&quot; or &quot;rh&quot;</DD>
<DT>KERNEL_VERSION</DT>
<DD>the kernel version number, as in &quot;2.2&quot; or &quot;2.4&quot;.</DD>
<DT>KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC</DT>
<DD>This variable should set in the environment, probably in
 ~/freeswan-regress-env.sh. Examples of this variables would be
 KERNEL_LINUS2_0_SRC or KERNEL_RH7_3_SRC. This variable should point to
 an extracted copy of the kernel source in question.</DD>
<DT>REF_PATCH_OUTPUT</DT>
<DD>a copy of the patch output to compare against</DD>
<DT>KERNEL_PATCH_LEAVE_SOURCE</DT>
<DD>If set to a non-empty string, then the patched kernel source is not
 removed at the end of the test. This will typically be set in the
 environment while debugging.</DD>
</DL>
<H2 NAME="modtest"><A NAME="39_12">module_compile paramaters</A></H2>
<P> The module_compile test attempts to build the KLIPS module against a
 given set of kernel source. This is also done by the RPM tests, but in
 a very specific manner.</P>
<P> There are two variations of this test - one where the kernel either
 doesn't need to be configured, or is already done, and tests were there
 is a local configuration file.</P>
<P> Where the kernel doesn't need to be configured, the kernel source
 that is found is simply used. It may be a RedHat-style kernel, where
 one can cause it to configure itself via rhconfig.h-style definitions.
 Or, it may just be a kernel tree that has been configured.</P>
<P> If the variable KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE is set, then a new directory is
 created for the kernel source. It is populated with lndir(1). The
 referenced file is then copied in as .config, and &quot;make oldconfig&quot; is
 used to configure the kernel. This resulting kernel is then used as the
 reference source.</P>
<P> In all cases, the kernel source is found the same was for the
 kernelpatch test, i.e. via KERNEL_VERSION/KERNEL_NAME and
 KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC.</P>
<P> Once there is kernel source, the module is compiled using the
 top-level &quot;make module&quot; target.</P>
<P> The test is considered successful if an executable is found in
 OUTPUT/module/ipsec.o at the end of the test.</P>
<DL>
<DT>KERNEL_NAME</DT>
<DD>the kernel name, typically something like &quot;linus&quot; or &quot;rh&quot;</DD>
<DT>KERNEL_VERSION</DT>
<DD>the kernel version number, as in &quot;2.2&quot; or &quot;2.4&quot;.</DD>
<DT>KERNEL_${KERNEL_NAME}${KERNEL_VERSION}_SRC</DT>
<DD>This variable should set in the environment, probably in
 ~/freeswan-regress-env.sh. Examples of this variables would be
 KERNEL_LINUS2_0_SRC or KERNEL_RH7_3_SRC. This variable should point to
 an extracted copy of the kernel source in question.</DD>
<DT>KERNEL_CONFIG_FILE</DT>
<DD>The configuration file for the kernel.</DD>
<DT>KERNEL_PATCH_LEAVE_SOURCE</DT>
<DD>If set to a non-empty string, then the configured kernel source is
 not removed at the end of the test. This will typically be set in the
 environment while debugging.</DD>
<DT>MODULE_DEF_INCLUDE</DT>
<DD>The include file that will be used to configure the KLIPS module,
 and possibly the kernel source.</DD>

<DD> This is a non-fatal warning. If uml_netjig is invoked with the -t
 option, then it will attempt to use tcpdump's dissector to decode each
 packet that it processes. The dissector is presently not available, so
 this option it normally turned off at compile time. The dissector
 library will be released with tcpdump version 4.0.</DD>
