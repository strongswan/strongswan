strongswan-4.1.4
----------------

- The pluto IKEv1 daemon now exhibits the same behaviour as its
  IKEv2 companion charon by inserting an explicit route via the
  _updown script only if a sourceip exists. This is admissible
  since routing through the IPsec tunnel is handled automatically
  by NETKEY's IPsec policies. As a consequence the left|rightnexthop
  parameter is not required any more.

- The new IKEv1 parameter right|leftallowany parameters helps to handle
  the case where both peers possess dynamic IP addresses that are
  usually resolved using DynDNS or a similar service. The configuration

    right=peer.foo.bar
    rightallowany=yes

  can be used by the initiator to start up a connection to a peer
  by resolving peer.foo.bar into the currently allocated IP address.
  Thanks to the rightallowany flag the connection behaves later on
  as

   right=%any

  so that the peer can rekey the connection as an initiator when his
  IP address changes. An alternative notation is

    right=%peer.foo.bar

  which will implicitly set rightallowany=yes.

- ipsec starter now fails more gracefully in the presence of parsing
  errors. Flawed ca and conn section are discarded and pluto is started
  if non-fatal errors only were encountered. If right=%peer.foo.bar
  cannot be resolved by DNS then right=%any will be used so that passive
  connections as a responder are still possible.

- The new pkcs11initargs parameter that can be placed in the
  setup config section of /etc/ipsec.conf allows the definition
  of an argument string that is used with the PKCS#11 C_Initialize()
  function. This non-standard feature is required by the NSS softoken
  library. This patch was contributed by Robert Varga.
	
- Fixed a bug in ipsec starter introduced by strongswan-2.8.5
  which caused a segmentation fault in the presence of unknown
  or misspelt keywords in ipsec.conf. This bug fix was contributed
  by Robert Varga.

- Partial support for MOBIKE in IKEv2. The initiator acts on interface/
  address configuration changes and updates IKE and IPsec SAs dynamically.


strongswan-4.1.3
----------------

- IKEv2 peer configuration selection now can be based on a given 
  certification authority using the rightca= statement.

- IKEv2 authentication based on RSA signatures now can handle multiple
  certificates issued for a given peer ID. This allows a smooth transition
  in the case of a peer certificate renewal.

- IKEv2: Support for requesting a specific virtual IP using leftsourceip on the
  client and returning requested virtual IPs using rightsourceip=%config
  on the server. If the server does not support configuration payloads, the
  client enforces its leftsourceip parameter.

- The ./configure options --with-uid/--with-gid allow pluto and charon
  to drop their privileges to a minimum and change to an other UID/GID. This
  improves the systems security, as a possible intruder may only get the
  CAP_NET_ADMIN capability.

- Further modularization of charon: Pluggable control interface and 
  configuration backend modules provide extensibility. The control interface
  for stroke is included, and further interfaces using DBUS (NetworkManager)
  or XML are on the way. A backend for storing configurations in the daemon
  is provided and more advanced backends (using e.g. a database) are trivial 
  to implement.

 - Fixed a compilation failure in libfreeswan occuring with Linux kernel
   headers > 2.6.17.


strongswan-4.1.2
----------------

- Support for an additional Diffie-Hellman exchange when creating/rekeying
  a CHILD_SA in IKEv2 (PFS). PFS is enabled when the proposal contains a
  DH group (e.g. "esp=aes128-sha1-modp1536"). Further, DH group negotiation
  is implemented properly for rekeying.

- Support for the AES-XCBC-96 MAC algorithm for IPsec SAs when using IKEv2
  (requires linux >= 2.6.20). It is enabled using e.g. "esp=aes256-aesxcbc".

- Working IPv4-in-IPv6 and IPv6-in-IPv4 tunnels for linux >= 2.6.21.

- Added support for EAP modules which do not establish an MSK.

- Removed the dependencies from the /usr/include/linux/ headers by
  including xfrm.h, ipsec.h, and pfkeyv2.h in the distribution.
  
- crlNumber is now listed by ipsec listcrls

- The xauth_modules.verify_secret() function now passes the
  connection name.


strongswan-4.1.1
----------------

- Server side cookie support. If to may IKE_SAs are in CONNECTING state,
  cookies are enabled and protect against DoS attacks with faked source
  addresses. Number of IKE_SAs in CONNECTING state is also limited per
  peer address to avoid resource exhaustion. IKE_SA_INIT messages are
  compared to properly detect retransmissions and incoming retransmits are
  detected even if the IKE_SA is blocked (e.g. doing OCSP fetches).

- The IKEv2 daemon charon now supports dynamic http- and ldap-based CRL
  fetching enabled by crlcheckinterval > 0 and caching fetched CRLs
  enabled by cachecrls=yes.

- Added the configuration options --enable-nat-transport which enables
  the potentially insecure NAT traversal for IPsec transport mode and
  --disable-vendor-id which disables the sending of the strongSwan
  vendor ID.

- Fixed a long-standing bug in the pluto IKEv1 daemon which caused
  a segmentation fault if a malformed payload was detected in the
  IKE MR2 message and pluto tried to send an encrypted notification
  message.

- Added the NATT_IETF_02_N Vendor ID in order to support IKEv1 connections
  with Windows 2003 Server which uses a wrong VID hash.


strongswan-4.1.0
----------------

- Support of SHA2_384 hash function for protecting IKEv1
  negotiations and support of SHA2 signatures in X.509 certificates.

- Fixed a serious bug in the computation of the SHA2-512 HMAC
  function. Introduced automatic self-test of all IKEv1 hash
  and hmac functions during pluto startup. Failure of a self-test
  currently issues a warning only but does not exit pluto [yet].

- Support for SHA2-256/384/512 PRF and HMAC functions in IKEv2.

- Full support of CA information sections. ipsec listcainfos
  now shows all collected crlDistributionPoints and OCSP 
  accessLocations.

- Support of the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) for IKEv2.
  This feature requires the HTTP fetching capabilities of the libcurl
  library which must be enabled by setting the --enable-http configure
  option.

- Refactored core of the IKEv2 message processing code, allowing better
  code reuse and separation.

- Virtual IP support in IKEv2 using INTERNAL_IP4/6_ADDRESS configuration
  payload. Additionally, the INTERNAL_IP4/6_DNS attribute is interpreted
  by the requestor and installed in a resolv.conf file.

- The IKEv2 daemon charon installs a route for each IPsec policy to use
  the correct source address even if an application does not explicitly
  specify it.

- Integrated the EAP framework into charon which loads pluggable EAP library
  modules. The ipsec.conf parameter authby=eap initiates EAP authentication
  on the client side, while the "eap" parameter on the server side defines
  the EAP method to use for client authentication.
  A generic client side EAP-Identity module and an EAP-SIM authentication
  module using a third party card reader implementation are included.

- Added client side support for cookies.

- Integrated the fixes done at the IKEv2 interoperability bakeoff, including
  strict payload order, correct INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD rejection and other minor
  fixes to enhance interoperability with other implementations.


strongswan-4.0.7
----------------

- strongSwan now interoperates with the NCP Secure Entry Client,
  the Shrew Soft VPN Client, and the Cisco VPN client, doing both
  XAUTH and Mode Config.

- UNITY attributes are now recognized and UNITY_BANNER is set
  to a default string.


strongswan-4.0.6
----------------

- IKEv1: Support for extended authentication (XAUTH) in combination
  with ISAKMP Main Mode RSA or PSK authentication. Both client and
  server side were implemented. Handling of user credentials can
  be done by a run-time loadable XAUTH module. By default user
  credentials are stored in ipsec.secrets. 
	  
- IKEv2: Support for reauthentication when rekeying

- IKEv2: Support for transport mode

- fixed a lot of bugs related to byte order

- various other bugfixes


strongswan-4.0.5
----------------

- IKEv1: Implementation of ModeConfig push mode via the new connection
  keyword modeconfig=push allows interoperability with Cisco VPN gateways.

- IKEv1: The command ipsec statusall now shows "DPD active" for all
  ISAKMP SAs that are under active Dead Peer Detection control.

- IKEv2: Charon's logging and debugging framework has been completely rewritten.
  Instead of logger, special printf() functions are used to directly
  print objects like hosts (%H) identifications (%D), certificates (%Q),
  etc. The number of debugging levels have been reduced to:

    0 (audit), 1 (control), 2 (controlmore),  3 (raw), 4 (private)

  The debugging levels can either be specified statically in ipsec.conf as

    config setup
           charondebug="lib 1, cfg 3, net 2"

  or changed at runtime via stroke as

    ipsec stroke loglevel cfg 2


strongswan-4.0.4
----------------

- Implemented full support for IPv6-in-IPv6 tunnels.

- Added configuration options for dead peer detection in IKEv2. dpd_action
  types "clear", "hold" and "restart" are supported. The dpd_timeout
  value is not used, as the normal retransmission policy applies to
  detect dead peers. The dpd_delay parameter enables sending of empty
  informational message to detect dead peers in case of inactivity.

- Added support for preshared keys in IKEv2. PSK keys configured in
  ipsec.secrets are loaded. The authby parameter specifies the authentication
  method to authentificate ourself, the other peer may use PSK or RSA.

- Changed retransmission policy to respect the keyingtries parameter.

- Added private key decryption. PEM keys encrypted with AES-128/192/256
  or 3DES are supported.

- Implemented DES/3DES algorithms in libstrongswan. 3DES can be used to
  encrypt IKE traffic.

- Implemented SHA-256/384/512 in libstrongswan, allows usage of certificates
  signed with such a hash algorithm.

- Added initial support for updown scripts. The actions up-host/client and
  down-host/client are executed. The leftfirewall=yes parameter
  uses the default updown script to insert dynamic firewall rules, a custom
  updown script may be specified with the leftupdown parameter.


strongswan-4.0.3
----------------

- Added support for the auto=route ipsec.conf parameter and the
  ipsec route/unroute commands for IKEv2. This allows to set up IKE_SAs and 
  CHILD_SAs dynamically on demand when traffic is detected by the 
  kernel.

- Added support for rekeying IKE_SAs in IKEv2 using the ikelifetime parameter.
  As specified in IKEv2, no reauthentication is done (unlike in IKEv1), only
  new keys are generated using perfect forward secrecy. An optional flag
  which enforces reauthentication will be implemented later.

- "sha" and "sha1" are now treated as synonyms in the ike= and esp=
  algorithm configuration statements.


strongswan-4.0.2
----------------

- Full X.509 certificate trust chain verification has been implemented.
  End entity certificates can be exchanged via CERT payloads. The current
  default is leftsendcert=always, since CERTREQ payloads are not supported
  yet. Optional CRLs must be imported locally into /etc/ipsec.d/crls.

- Added support for leftprotoport/rightprotoport parameters in IKEv2. IKEv2 
  would offer more possibilities for traffic selection, but the Linux kernel
  currently does not support it. That's why we stick with these simple 
  ipsec.conf rules for now.

- Added Dead Peer Detection (DPD) which checks liveliness of remote peer if no
  IKE or ESP traffic is received. DPD is currently hardcoded (dpdaction=clear,
  dpddelay=60s).

- Initial NAT traversal support in IKEv2. Charon includes NAT detection
  notify payloads to detect NAT routers between the peers. It switches
  to port 4500, uses UDP encapsulated ESP packets, handles peer address
  changes gracefully and sends keep alive message periodically.

- Reimplemented IKE_SA state machine for charon, which allows simultaneous 
  rekeying, more shared code, cleaner design, proper retransmission 
  and a more extensible code base.

- The mixed PSK/RSA roadwarrior detection capability introduced by the
  strongswan-2.7.0 release necessitated the pre-parsing of the IKE proposal
  payloads by the responder right before any defined IKE Main Mode state had
  been established. Although any form of bad proposal syntax was being correctly
  detected by the payload parser, the subsequent error handler didn't check
  the state pointer before logging current state information, causing an
  immediate crash of the pluto keying daemon due to a NULL pointer.


strongswan-4.0.1
----------------

- Added algorithm selection to charon: New default algorithms for 
  ike=aes128-sha-modp2048, as both daemons support it. The default
  for IPsec SAs is now esp=aes128-sha,3des-md5. charon handles
  the ike/esp parameter the same way as pluto. As this syntax does
  not allow specification of a pseudo random function, the same 
  algorithm as for integrity is used (currently sha/md5). Supported
  algorithms for IKE:
    Encryption: aes128, aes192, aes256
    Integrity/PRF: md5, sha (using hmac)
    DH-Groups: modp768, 1024, 1536, 2048, 4096, 8192
  and for ESP:
    Encryption: aes128, aes192, aes256, 3des, blowfish128, 
                blowfish192, blowfish256
    Integrity: md5, sha1
  More IKE encryption algorithms will come after porting libcrypto into
  libstrongswan. 

- initial support for rekeying CHILD_SAs using IKEv2. Currently no
  perfect forward secrecy is used. The rekeying parameters rekey,
  rekeymargin, rekeyfuzz and keylife from ipsec.conf are now supported
  when using IKEv2. WARNING: charon currently is unable to handle
  simultaneous rekeying. To avoid such a situation, use a large
  rekeyfuzz, or even better, set rekey=no on one peer.

- support for host2host, net2net, host2net (roadwarrior) tunnels
  using predefined RSA certificates (see uml scenarios for
  configuration examples).

- new build environment featuring autotools. Features such
  as HTTP, LDAP and smartcard support may be enabled using
  the ./configure script. Changing install directories 
  is possible, too. See ./configure --help for more details.

- better integration of charon with ipsec starter, which allows
  (almost) transparent operation with both daemons. charon
  handles ipsec commands up, down, status, statusall, listall,
  listcerts and allows proper load, reload and delete of connections
  via ipsec starter.


strongswan-4.0.0
----------------

- initial support of the IKEv2 protocol. Connections in
  ipsec.conf designated by keyexchange=ikev2 are negotiated 
  by the new IKEv2 charon keying daemon whereas those marked
  by keyexchange=ikev1 or the default keyexchange=ike are
  handled thy the IKEv1 pluto keying daemon. Currently only
  a limited subset of functions are available with IKEv2
  (Default AES encryption, authentication based on locally
  imported X.509 certificates, unencrypted private RSA keys
  in PKCS#1 file format, limited functionality of the ipsec
  status command).


strongswan-2.7.0
----------------

- the dynamic iptables rules from the _updown_x509 template
  for KLIPS and the _updown_policy template for NETKEY have
  been merged into the default _updown script. The existing
  left|rightfirewall keyword causes the automatic insertion
  and deletion of ACCEPT rules for tunneled traffic upon
  the successful setup and teardown of an IPsec SA, respectively.
  left|rightfirwall can be used with KLIPS under any Linux 2.4
  kernel or with NETKEY under a Linux kernel version >= 2.6.16
  in conjuction with iptables >= 1.3.5. For NETKEY under a Linux
  kernel version < 2.6.16 which does not support IPsec policy
  matching yet, please continue to use a copy of the _updown_espmark
  template loaded via the left|rightupdown keyword.

- a new left|righthostaccess keyword has been introduced which
  can be used in conjunction with left|rightfirewall and the
  default _updown script. By default leftfirewall=yes inserts
  a bi-directional iptables FORWARD rule for a local client network
  with a netmask different from 255.255.255.255 (single host).
  This does not allow to access the VPN gateway host via its
  internal network interface which is part of the client subnet
  because an iptables INPUT and OUTPUT rule would be required.
  lefthostaccess=yes will cause this additional ACCEPT rules to
  be inserted. 

- mixed PSK|RSA roadwarriors are now supported. The ISAKMP proposal
  payload is preparsed in order to find out whether the roadwarrior
  requests PSK or RSA so that a matching connection candidate can
  be found.


strongswan-2.6.4
----------------

- the new _updown_policy template allows ipsec policy based
  iptables firewall rules. Required are iptables version
  >= 1.3.5 and linux kernel >= 2.6.16. This script obsoletes
  the _updown_espmark template, so that no INPUT mangle rules 
  are required any more.

- added support of DPD restart mode

- ipsec starter now allows the use of wildcards in include
  statements as e.g. in "include /etc/my_ipsec/*.conf".
  Patch courtesy of Matthias Haas.

- the Netscape OID 'employeeNumber' is now recognized and can be
  used as a Relative Distinguished Name in certificates.


strongswan-2.6.3
----------------

- /etc/init.d/ipsec or /etc/rc.d/ipsec is now a copy of the ipsec 
  command and not of ipsec setup any more.

- ipsec starter now supports AH authentication in conjunction with
  ESP encryption. AH authentication is configured in ipsec.conf
  via the auth=ah parameter.
  
- The command ipsec scencrypt|scdecrypt <args> is now an alias for
  ipsec whack --scencrypt|scdecrypt <args>.

- get_sa_info() now determines for the native netkey IPsec stack
  the exact time of the last use of an active eroute. This information
  is used by the Dead Peer Detection algorithm and is also displayed by
  the ipsec status command.
  

strongswan-2.6.2
----------------

- running under the native Linux 2.6 IPsec stack, the function
  get_sa_info() is called by ipsec auto --status to display the current
  number of transmitted bytes per IPsec SA.

- get_sa_info() is also used  by the Dead Peer Detection process to detect
  recent ESP activity. If ESP traffic was received from the peer within
  the last dpd_delay interval then no R_Y_THERE notification must be sent.

- strongSwan now supports the Relative Distinguished Name "unstructuredName"
  in ID_DER_ASN1_DN identities. The following notations are possible:

    rightid="unstructuredName=John Doe"
    rightid="UN=John Doe"

- fixed a long-standing bug which caused PSK-based roadwarrior connections
  to segfault in the function id.c:same_id() called by keys.c:get_secret()
  if an FQDN, USER_FQDN, or Key ID was defined, as in the following example.

  conn rw
       right=%any
       rightid=@foo.bar
       authby=secret

- the ipsec command now supports most ipsec auto commands (e.g. ipsec listall).

- ipsec starter didn't set host_addr and client.addr ports in whack msg.

- in order to guarantee backwards-compatibility with the script-based
  auto function (e.g. auto --replace), the ipsec starter scripts stores
  the defaultroute information in the temporary file /var/run/ipsec.info.

- The compile-time option USE_XAUTH_VID enables the sending of the XAUTH
  Vendor ID which is expected by Cisco PIX 7 boxes that act as IKE Mode Config
  servers.

- the ipsec starter now also recognizes the parameters authby=never and
  type=passthrough|pass|drop|reject.


strongswan-2.6.1
----------------

- ipsec starter now supports the also parameter which allows
  a modular structure of the connection definitions. Thus
  "ipsec start" is now ready to replace "ipsec setup".


strongswan-2.6.0
----------------

- Mathieu Lafon's popular ipsec starter tool has been added to the
  strongSwan distribution. Many thanks go to Stephan Scholz from astaro
  for his integration work. ipsec starter is a C program which is going
  to replace the various shell and awk starter scripts (setup, _plutoload,
  _plutostart, _realsetup, _startklips, _confread, and auto). Since
  ipsec.conf is now parsed only once, the starting of multiple tunnels is
  accelerated tremedously.

- Added support of %defaultroute to the ipsec starter. If the IP address
  changes, a HUP signal to the ipsec starter will automatically 
  reload pluto's connections.

- moved most compile time configurations from pluto/Makefile to
  Makefile.inc by defining the options USE_LIBCURL, USE_LDAP,
  USE_SMARTCARD, and USE_NAT_TRAVERSAL_TRANSPORT_MODE.

- removed the ipsec verify and ipsec newhostkey commands

- fixed some 64-bit issues in formatted print statements

- The scepclient functionality implementing the Simple Certificate
  Enrollment Protocol (SCEP) is nearly complete but hasn't been
  documented yet.


strongswan-2.5.7
----------------

- CA certicates are now automatically loaded from a smartcard
  or USB crypto token and appear in the ipsec auto --listcacerts
  listing.


strongswan-2.5.6
----------------

- when using "ipsec whack --scencrypt <data>" with  a PKCS#11
  library that does not support the C_Encrypt() Cryptoki
  function (e.g. OpenSC), the RSA encryption is done in
  software using the public key fetched from the smartcard.

- The scepclient function now allows to define the 
  validity of a self-signed certificate using the --days,
  --startdate, and --enddate options. The default validity
  has been changed from one year to five years.


strongswan-2.5.5
----------------

- the config setup parameter pkcs11proxy=yes opens pluto's PKCS#11
  interface to other applications for RSA encryption and decryption
  via the whack interface. Notation:

  ipsec whack --scencrypt <data>
             [--inbase  16|hex|64|base64|256|text|ascii]
             [--outbase 16|hex|64|base64|256|text|ascii]
             [--keyid <keyid>]

  ipsec whack --scdecrypt <data>
             [--inbase  16|hex|64|base64|256|text|ascii]
             [--outbase 16|hex|64|base64|256|text|ascii]
             [--keyid <keyid>]

  The default setting for inbase and outbase is hex. 

  The new proxy interface can be used for securing symmetric
  encryption keys required by the cryptoloop or dm-crypt
  disk encryption schemes, especially in the case when
  pkcs11keepstate=yes causes pluto to lock the pkcs11 slot
  permanently.

- if the file /etc/ipsec.secrets is lacking during the startup of
  pluto then the root-readable file /etc/ipsec.d/private/myKey.der
  containing a 2048 bit RSA private key and a matching self-signed
  certificate stored in the file /etc/ipsec.d/certs/selfCert.der
  is automatically generated by calling the function

  ipsec scepclient --out pkcs1 --out cert-self

  scepclient was written by Jan Hutter and Martin Willi, students
  at the University of Applied Sciences in Rapperswil, Switzerland.


strongswan-2.5.4
----------------

- the current extension of the PKCS#7 framework introduced
  a parsing error in PKCS#7 wrapped X.509 certificates that are
  e.g. transmitted by Windows XP when multi-level CAs are used.
  the parsing syntax has been fixed.

- added a patch by Gerald Richter which tolerates multiple occurrences
  of the ipsec0 interface when using KLIPS.


strongswan-2.5.3
----------------

- with gawk-3.1.4 the word "default2 has become a protected
  keyword for use in switch statements and cannot be used any
  more in the strongSwan scripts. This problem has been
  solved by renaming "default" to "defaults" and "setdefault"
  in the scripts _confread and auto, respectively.

- introduced the parameter leftsendcert with the values

  always|yes (the default, always send a cert)
  ifasked    (send the cert only upon a cert request)
  never|no   (never send a cert, used for raw RSA keys and
              self-signed certs) 

- fixed the initialization of the ESP key length to a default of
  128 bits in the case that the peer does not send a key length
   attribute for AES encryption.

- applied Herbert Xu's uniqueIDs patch

- applied Herbert Xu's CLOEXEC patches


strongswan-2.5.2
----------------

- CRLs can now be cached also in the case when the issuer's
  certificate does not contain a subjectKeyIdentifier field.
  In that case the subjectKeyIdentifier is computed by pluto as the
  160 bit SHA-1 hash of the issuer's public key in compliance
  with section 4.2.1.2 of RFC 3280.

- Fixed a bug introduced by strongswan-2.5.1 which eliminated
  not only multiple Quick Modes of a given connection but also
  multiple connections between two security gateways.


strongswan-2.5.1
----------------

- Under the native IPsec of the Linux 2.6 kernel, a %trap eroute
  installed either by setting auto=route in ipsec.conf or by
  a connection put into hold, generates an XFRM_AQUIRE event
  for each packet that wants to use the not-yet exisiting
  tunnel. Up to now each XFRM_AQUIRE event led to an entry in
  the Quick Mode queue, causing multiple IPsec SA to be
  established in rapid succession. Starting with strongswan-2.5.1
  only a single IPsec SA is established per host-pair connection.

- Right after loading the PKCS#11 module, all smartcard slots are
  searched for certificates. The result can be viewed using
  the command

    ipsec auto --listcards

  The certificate objects found in the slots are numbered
  starting with #1, #2, etc. This position number can be used to address
  certificates (leftcert=%smartcard) and keys (: PIN %smartcard)
  in ipsec.conf and ipsec.secrets, respectively:

    %smartcard      (selects object #1)
    %smartcard#1    (selects object #1)
    %smartcard#3    (selects object #3)

  As an alternative the existing retrieval scheme can be used:

    %smartcard:45   (selects object with id=45)
    %smartcard0     (selects first object in slot 0)
    %smartcard4:45  (selects object in slot 4 with id=45)

- Depending on the settings of CKA_SIGN and CKA_DECRYPT
  private key flags either C_Sign() or C_Decrypt() is used
  to generate a signature.

- The output buffer length parameter siglen in C_Sign()
  is now initialized to the actual size of the output
  buffer prior to the function call. This fixes the
  CKR_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL error that could occur when using
  the OpenSC PKCS#11 module.

- Changed the initialization of the PKCS#11 CK_MECHANISM in
  C_SignInit() to mech  = { CKM_RSA_PKCS, NULL_PTR, 0 }.

- Refactored the RSA public/private key code and transferred it
  from keys.c to the new pkcs1.c file as a preparatory step
  towards the release of the SCEP client.


strongswan-2.5.0
----------------

- The loading of a PKCS#11 smartcard library module during
  runtime does not require OpenSC library functions any more
  because the corresponding code has been integrated into
  smartcard.c. Also the RSAREF pkcs11 header files have been
  included in a newly created pluto/rsaref directory so that
  no external include path has to be defined any longer.

- A long-awaited feature has been implemented at last:
  The local caching of CRLs fetched via HTTP or LDAP, activated
  by the parameter cachecrls=yes in the config setup section
  of ipsec.conf. The dynamically fetched CRLs are stored under
  a unique file name containing the issuer's subjectKeyID
  in /etc/ipsec.d/crls.
  
- Applied a one-line patch courtesy of Michael Richardson
  from the Openswan project which fixes the kernel-oops
  in KLIPS when an snmp daemon is running on the same box.


strongswan-2.4.4
----------------

- Eliminated null length CRL distribution point strings.

- Fixed a trust path evaluation bug introduced with 2.4.3


strongswan-2.4.3
----------------

- Improved the joint OCSP / CRL revocation policy.
  OCSP responses have precedence over CRL entries.

- Introduced support of CRLv2 reason codes.

- Fixed a bug with key-pad equipped readers which caused
  pluto to prompt for the pin via the console when the first
  occasion to enter the pin via the key-pad was missed.

- When pluto is built with LDAP_V3 enabled, the library
  liblber required by newer versions of openldap is now
  included.


strongswan-2.4.2
----------------

- Added the _updown_espmark template which requires all
  incoming ESP traffic to be marked with a default mark
  value of 50.
  
- Introduced the pkcs11keepstate parameter in the config setup
  section of ipsec.conf. With pkcs11keepstate=yes the PKCS#11
  session and login states are kept as long as possible during 
  the lifetime of pluto. This means that a PIN entry via a key
  pad has to be done only once.

- Introduced the pkcs11module parameter in the config setup
  section of ipsec.conf which specifies the PKCS#11 module
  to be used with smart cards. Example:
  
    pkcs11module=/usr/lib/pkcs11/opensc-pkcs11.lo
  
- Added support of smartcard readers equipped with a PIN pad.

- Added patch by Jay Pfeifer which detects when netkey
  modules have been statically built into the Linux 2.6 kernel.

- Added two patches by Herbert Xu. The first uses ip xfrm
  instead of setkey to flush the IPsec policy database. The
  second sets the optional flag in inbound IPComp SAs only.
    
- Applied Ulrich Weber's patch which fixes an interoperability
  problem between native IPsec and KLIPS systems caused by
  setting the replay window to 32 instead of 0 for ipcomp.


strongswan-2.4.1
----------------

- Fixed a bug which caused an unwanted Mode Config request
  to be initiated in the case where "right" was used to denote
  the local side in ipsec.conf and "left" the remote side,
  contrary to the recommendation that "right" be remote and
  "left" be"local".


strongswan-2.4.0a
-----------------

- updated Vendor ID to strongSwan-2.4.0

- updated copyright statement to include David Buechi and
  Michael Meier
  
  
strongswan-2.4.0
----------------

- strongSwan now communicates with attached smartcards and
  USB crypto tokens via the standardized PKCS #11 interface.
  By default the OpenSC library from www.opensc.org is used
  but any other PKCS#11 library could be dynamically linked.
  strongSwan's PKCS#11 API was implemented by David Buechi
  and Michael Meier, both graduates of the Zurich University
  of Applied Sciences in Winterthur, Switzerland.

- When a %trap eroute is triggered by an outgoing IP packet
  then the native IPsec stack of the Linux 2.6 kernel [often/
  always?] returns an XFRM_ACQUIRE message with an undefined
  protocol family field and the connection setup fails.
  As a workaround IPv4 (AF_INET) is now assumed.
  
- the results of the UML test scenarios are now enhanced 
  with block diagrams of the virtual network topology used
  in a particular test. 


strongswan-2.3.2
----------------

- fixed IV used to decrypt informational messages.
  This bug was introduced with Mode Config functionality.
 
- fixed NCP Vendor ID.

- undid one of Ulrich Weber's maximum udp size patches
  because it caused a segmentation fault with NAT-ed
  Delete SA messages.
  
- added UML scenarios wildcards and attr-cert which
  demonstrate the implementation of IPsec policies based
  on wildcard parameters contained in Distinguished Names and
  on X.509 attribute certificates, respectively.


strongswan-2.3.1
----------------

- Added basic Mode Config functionality

- Added Mathieu Lafon's patch which upgrades the status of
  the NAT-Traversal implementation to RFC 3947.
 
- The _startklips script now also loads the xfrm4_tunnel
  module.
  
- Added Ulrich Weber's netlink replay window size and
  maximum udp size patches.

- UML testing now uses the Linux 2.6.10 UML kernel by default.
   

strongswan-2.3.0
----------------

- Eric Marchionni and Patrik Rayo, both recent graduates from
  the Zuercher Hochschule Winterthur in Switzerland, created a
  User-Mode-Linux test setup for strongSwan. For more details
  please read the INSTALL and README documents in the testing
  subdirectory.

- Full support of group attributes based on X.509 attribute
  certificates. Attribute certificates can be generated 
  using the openac facility. For more details see
   
  man ipsec_openac.
 
  The group attributes can be used in connection definitions
  in order to give IPsec access to specific user groups.
  This is done with the new parameter left|rightgroups as in
  
  rightgroups="Research, Sales"

  giving access to users possessing the group attributes
  Research or Sales, only.

- In Quick Mode clients with subnet mask /32 are now
  coded as IP_V4_ADDRESS or IP_V6_ADDRESS. This should 
  fix rekeying problems with the SafeNet/SoftRemote and NCP
  Secure Entry Clients.

- Changed the defaults of the ikelifetime and keylife parameters
  to 3h and 1h, respectively. The maximum allowable values are
  now both set to 24 h.

- Suppressed notification wars between two IPsec peers that
  could e.g. be triggered by incorrect ISAKMP encryption.

- Public RSA keys can now have identical IDs if either the
  issuing CA or the serial number is different. The serial
  number of a certificate is now shown by the command
  
  ipsec auto --listpubkeys


strongswan-2.2.2
----------------

- Added Tuomo Soini's sourceip feature which allows a strongSwan
  roadwarrior to use a fixed Virtual IP (see README section 2.6)
  and reduces the well-known four tunnel case on VPN gateways to
  a single tunnel definition (see README section 2.4).

- Fixed a bug occuring with NAT-Traversal enabled when the responder
  suddenly turns initiator and the initiator cannot find a matching
  connection because of the floated IKE port 4500.
  
- Removed misleading ipsec verify command from barf.

- Running under the native IP stack, ipsec --version now shows
  the Linux kernel version (courtesy to the Openswan project).


strongswan-2.2.1
----------------

- Introduced the ipsec auto --listalgs monitoring command which lists
  all currently registered IKE and ESP algorithms.

- Fixed a bug in the ESP algorithm selection occuring when the strict flag
  is set and the first proposed transform does not match.
  
- Fixed another deadlock in the use of the lock_certs_and_keys() mutex,
  occuring when a smartcard is present.

- Prevented that a superseded Phase1 state can trigger a DPD_TIMEOUT event.
  
- Fixed the printing of the notification names (null)

- Applied another of Herbert Xu's Netlink patches.


strongswan-2.2.0
----------------

- Support of Dead Peer Detection. The connection parameter

    dpdaction=clear|hold
     
  activates DPD for the given connection.

- The default Opportunistic Encryption (OE) policy groups are not
  automatically included anymore. Those wishing to activate OE can include
  the policy group with the following statement in ipsec.conf:
  
    include /etc/ipsec.d/examples/oe.conf
  
  The default for [right|left]rsasigkey is now set to %cert.

- strongSwan now has a Vendor ID of its own which can be activated
  using the compile option VENDORID

- Applied Herbert Xu's patch which sets the compression algorithm correctly.

- Applied Herbert Xu's patch fixing an ESPINUDP problem

- Applied Herbert Xu's patch setting source/destination port numbers.

- Reapplied one of Herbert Xu's NAT-Traversal patches which got
  lost during the migration from SuperFreeS/WAN.
  
- Fixed a deadlock in the use of the lock_certs_and_keys() mutex.

- Fixed the unsharing of alg parameters when instantiating group
  connection.
  

strongswan-2.1.5
----------------

- Thomas Walpuski made me aware of a potential DoS attack via
  a PKCS#7-wrapped certificate bundle which could overwrite valid CA
  certificates in Pluto's authority certificate store. This vulnerability
  was fixed by establishing trust in CA candidate certificates up to a
  trusted root CA prior to insertion into Pluto's chained list.

- replaced the --assign option by the -v option in the auto awk script
  in order to make it run with mawk under debian/woody.


strongswan-2.1.4
----------------

- Split of the status information between ipsec auto  --status (concise)
  and ipsec auto --statusall (verbose). Both commands can be used with
  an optional connection selector:

    ipsec auto --status[all] <connection_name>

- Added the description of X.509 related features to the ipsec_auto(8)
  man page.

- Hardened the ASN.1 parser in debug mode, especially the printing
  of malformed distinguished names.

- The size of an RSA public key received in a certificate is now restricted to

    512 bits <= modulus length <= 8192 bits.

- Fixed the debug mode enumeration.


strongswan-2.1.3
----------------

- Fixed another PKCS#7 vulnerability which could lead to an
  endless loop while following the X.509 trust chain.
  

strongswan-2.1.2
----------------

- Fixed the PKCS#7 vulnerability discovered by Thomas Walpuski
  that accepted end certificates having identical issuer and subject
  distinguished names in a multi-tier X.509 trust chain.
  

strongswan-2.1.1
----------------

- Removed all remaining references to ipsec_netlink.h in KLIPS.


strongswan-2.1.0
----------------

- The new "ca" section allows to define the following parameters:

  ca kool
     cacert=koolCA.pem                   # cacert of kool CA
     ocspuri=http://ocsp.kool.net:8001   # ocsp server
     ldapserver=ldap.kool.net            # default ldap server
     crluri=http://www.kool.net/kool.crl # crl distribution point
     crluri2="ldap:///O=Kool, C= .."     # crl distribution point #2
     auto=add                            # add, ignore
     
  The ca definitions can be monitored via the command
  
     ipsec auto --listcainfos

- Fixed cosmetic corruption of /proc filesystem by integrating
  D. Hugh Redelmeier's freeswan-2.06 kernel fixes.


strongswan-2.0.2
----------------

- Added support for the 818043 NAT-Traversal update of Microsoft's
  Windows 2000/XP IPsec client which sends an ID_FQDN during Quick Mode.
  
- A symbolic link to libcrypto is now added in the kernel sources 
  during kernel compilation
  
- Fixed a couple of 64 bit issues (mostly casts to int).
  Thanks to Ken Bantoft who checked my sources on a 64 bit platform.

- Replaced s[n]printf() statements in the kernel by ipsec_snprintf().
  Credits go to D. Hugh Redelmeier, Michael Richardson, and Sam Sgro
  of the FreeS/WAN team who solved this problem with the 2.4.25 kernel.


strongswan-2.0.1
----------------

- an empty ASN.1 SEQUENCE OF or SET OF object (e.g. a subjectAltName
  certificate extension which contains no generalName item)  can cause
  a pluto crash. This bug has been fixed. Additionally the ASN.1 parser has
  been hardened to make it more robust against malformed ASN.1 objects.

- applied Herbert Xu's NAT-T patches which fixes NAT-T under the native
  Linux 2.6 IPsec stack.
  
  
strongswan-2.0.0
----------------

- based on freeswan-2.04, x509-1.5.3, nat-0.6c, alg-0.8.1rc12
