charon {}
	Options for the charon IKE daemon.

	Options for the charon IKE daemon.

	**Note**: Many of the options in this section also apply to **charon-cmd**
	and other **charon** derivatives.  Just use their respective name (e.g.
	**charon-cmd** instead of **charon**). For many options defaults can be
	defined in the **libstrongswan** section.

charon.accept_unencrypted_mainmode_messages = no
	Accept unencrypted ID and HASH payloads in IKEv1 Main Mode.

	Accept unencrypted ID and HASH payloads in IKEv1 Main Mode.

	Some implementations send the third Main Mode message unencrypted, probably
	to find the PSKs for the specified ID for authentication. This is very
	similar to Aggressive Mode, and has the same security implications: A
	passive attacker can sniff the negotiated Identity, and start brute forcing
	the PSK using the HASH payload.

	It is recommended to keep this option to no, unless you know exactly
	what the implications are and require compatibility to such devices (for
	example, some SonicWall boxes).

charon.block_threshold = 5
	Maximum number of half-open IKE_SAs for a single peer IP.

charon.cert_cache = yes
	Whether relations in validated certificate chains should be cached in
	memory.

charon.cisco_unity = no
	Send Cisco Unity vendor ID payload (IKEv1 only).

charon.close_ike_on_child_failure = no
	Close the IKE_SA if setup of the CHILD_SA along with IKE_AUTH failed.

charon.cookie_threshold = 10
	Number of half-open IKE_SAs that activate the cookie mechanism.

charon.crypto_test.bench = no
	Benchmark crypto algorithms and order them by efficiency.

charon.crypto_test.bench_size = 1024
	Buffer size used for crypto benchmark.

charon.crypto_test.bench_time = 50
	Number of iterations to test each algorithm.

charon.crypto_test.on_add = no
	Test crypto algorithms during registration (requires test vectors provided
	by the _test-vectors_ plugin).

charon.crypto_test.on_create = no
	Test crypto algorithms on each crypto primitive instantiation.

charon.crypto_test.required = no
	Strictly require at least one test vector to enable an algorithm.

charon.crypto_test.rng_true = no
	Whether to test RNG with TRUE quality; requires a lot of entropy.

charon.delete_rekeyed = no
	Delete CHILD_SAs right after they got successfully rekeyed (IKEv1 only).

	Delete CHILD_SAs right after they got successfully rekeyed (IKEv1 only).
	Reduces the number of stale CHILD_SAs in scenarios with a lot of rekeyings.
	However, this might cause problems with implementations that continue to
	use rekeyed SAs until they expire.

charon.dh_exponent_ansi_x9_42 = yes
	Use ANSI X9.42 DH exponent size or optimum size matched to cryptographic
	strength.

charon.dlopen_use_rtld_now = no
	Use RTLD_NOW with dlopen when loading plugins and IMV/IMCs to reveal missing
	symbols immediately.

charon.dns1
	DNS server assigned to peer via configuration payload (CP).

charon.dns2
	DNS server assigned to peer via configuration payload (CP).

charon.dos_protection = yes
	Enable Denial of Service protection using cookies and aggressiveness checks.

charon.ecp_x_coordinate_only = yes
	Compliance with the errata for RFC 4753.

charon.flush_auth_cfg = no
	Free objects during authentication (might conflict with plugins).

	If enabled objects used during authentication (certificates, identities
	etc.) are released to free memory once an IKE_SA is established. Enabling
	this might conflict with plugins that later need access to e.g. the used
	certificates.

charon.follow_redirects = yes
	Whether to follow IKEv2 redirects (RFC 5685).

charon.fragment_size = 1280
	Maximum size (complete IP datagram size in bytes) of a sent IKE fragment
	when using proprietary IKEv1 or standardized IKEv2 fragmentation, defaults
	to 1280 (use 0 for address family specific default values, which uses a
	lower value for IPv4).  If specified this limit is used for both IPv4 and
	IPv6.

charon.group
	Name of the group the daemon changes to after startup.

charon.half_open_timeout = 30
	Timeout in seconds for connecting IKE_SAs (also see IKE_SA_INIT DROPPING).

charon.hash_and_url = no
	Enable hash and URL support.

	Allow IKEv1 Aggressive Mode with pre-shared keys as responder.

	If enabled responders are allowed to use IKEv1 Aggressive Mode with
	pre-shared keys, which is discouraged due to security concerns (offline
	attacks on the openly transmitted hash of the PSK).

charon.ignore_routing_tables
	A space-separated list of routing tables to be excluded from route lookups.

charon.ignore_acquire_ts = no
	Whether to ignore the traffic selectors from the kernel's acquire events for
	IKEv2 connections (they are not used for IKEv1).

	If this is disabled the traffic selectors from the kernel's acquire events,
	which are derived from the triggering packet, are prepended to the traffic
	selectors from the configuration for IKEv2 connection. By enabling this,
	such specific traffic selectors will be ignored and only the ones in the
	config will	be sent. This always happens for IKEv1 connections as the
	protocol only supports one set of traffic selectors per CHILD_SA.

charon.ikesa_limit = 0
	Maximum number of IKE_SAs that can be established at the same time before
	new connection attempts are blocked.

charon.ikesa_table_segments = 1
	Number of exclusively locked segments in the hash table.

charon.ikesa_table_size = 1
	Size of the IKE_SA hash table.

	Install routes into a separate routing table for established IPsec tunnels.

charon.install_virtual_ip = yes
	Install virtual IP addresses.

charon.install_virtual_ip_on
	The name of the interface on which virtual IP addresses should be installed.

	The name of the interface on which virtual IP addresses should be installed.
	If not specified the addresses will be installed on the outbound interface.

charon.integrity_test = no
	Check daemon, libstrongswan and plugin integrity at startup.

charon.interfaces_ignore
	A comma-separated list of network interfaces that should be ignored, if
	**interfaces_use** is specified this option has no effect.

charon.interfaces_use
	A comma-separated list of network interfaces that should be used by charon.
	All other interfaces are ignored.

charon.keep_alive = 20s
	NAT keep alive interval.

charon.leak_detective.detailed = yes
	Includes source file names and line numbers in leak detective output.

charon.leak_detective.usage_threshold = 10240
	Threshold in bytes for leaks to be reported (0 to report all).

charon.leak_detective.usage_threshold_count = 0
	Threshold in number of allocations for leaks to be reported (0 to report
	all).

charon.load
	Plugins to load in the IKE daemon charon.

charon.load_modular = no
	Determine plugins to load via each plugin's load option.

	If enabled, the list of plugins to load is determined via the value of the
	_charon.plugins.<name>.load_ options.  In addition to a simple boolean flag
	that option may take an integer value indicating the priority of a plugin,
	which would influence the order of a plugin in the plugin list (the default
	is 1). If two plugins have the same priority their order in the default
	plugin list is preserved. Enabled plugins not found in that list are ordered
	alphabetically before other plugins with the same priority.

charon.max_ikev1_exchanges = 3
	Maximum number of IKEv1 phase 2 exchanges per IKE_SA to keep state about and
	track concurrently.

charon.max_packet = 10000
	Maximum packet size accepted by charon.

charon.make_before_break = no
	Initiate IKEv2 reauthentication with a make-before-break scheme.

	Initiate IKEv2 reauthentication with a make-before-break instead of a
	break-before-make scheme. Make-before-break uses overlapping IKE and
	CHILD_SA during reauthentication by first recreating all new SAs before
	deleting the old ones. This behavior can be beneficial to avoid connectivity
	gaps during reauthentication, but requires support for overlapping SAs by
	the peer. strongSwan can handle such overlapping SAs since version 5.3.0.

charon.multiple_authentication = yes
	Enable multiple authentication exchanges (RFC 4739).

charon.nbns1
	WINS servers assigned to peer via configuration payload (CP).

charon.nbns2
	WINS servers assigned to peer via configuration payload (CP).

charon.port = 500
	UDP port used locally. If set to 0 a random port will be allocated.

charon.port_nat_t = 4500
	UDP port used locally in case of NAT-T. If set to 0 a random port will be
	allocated.  Has to be different from **charon.port**, otherwise a random
	port will be allocated.

charon.prefer_configured_proposals = yes
	Prefer locally configured proposals for	IKE/IPsec over supplied ones as
	responder (disabling this can avoid keying retries due to INVALID_KE_PAYLOAD
	notifies).

charon.prefer_temporary_addrs = no
	By default public IPv6 addresses are preferred over temporary ones (RFC
	4941), to make connections more stable. Enable this option to reverse this.

charon.process_route = yes
	Process RTM_NEWROUTE and RTM_DELROUTE events.

charon.processor.priority_threads {}
	Section to configure the number of reserved threads per priority class
	see JOB PRIORITY MANAGEMENT in **strongswan.conf**(5).

	Size of the AH/ESP replay window, in packets.

charon.retransmit_base = 1.8
	Base to use for calculating exponential back off, see IKEv2 RETRANSMISSION
	in **strongswan.conf**(5).

charon.retransmit_timeout = 4.0
	Timeout in seconds before sending first retransmit.

charon.retransmit_tries = 5
	Number of times to retransmit a packet before giving up.

charon.retry_initiate_interval = 0
	Interval in seconds to use when retrying to initiate an IKE_SA (e.g. if DNS
	resolution failed), 0 to disable retries.

	Send strongSwan vendor ID payload

charon.signature_authentication = yes
	Whether to enable Signature Authentication as per RFC 7427.

charon.signature_authentication_constraints = yes
	Whether to enable constraints against IKEv2 signature schemes.

	If enabled, signature schemes configured in _rightauth_, in addition to
	getting used as constraints against signature schemes employed in the
	certificate chain, are also used as constraints against the signature scheme
	used by peers during IKEv2.

charon.start-scripts {}
	Section containing a list of scripts (name = path) that are executed when
	the daemon is started.

charon.stop-scripts {}
	Section containing a list of scripts (name = path) that are executed when
	the daemon is terminated.

charon.threads = 16
	Number of worker threads in charon.

	Number of worker threads in charon. Several of these are reserved for long
	running tasks in internal modules and plugins. Therefore, make sure you
	don't set this value too low. The number of idle worker threads listed in
	_ipsec statusall_ might be used as indicator on the number of reserved
	threads.

charon.tls.cipher
	List of TLS encryption ciphers.

charon.tls.key_exchange
	List of TLS key exchange methods.

charon.tls.mac
	List of TLS MAC algorithms.
