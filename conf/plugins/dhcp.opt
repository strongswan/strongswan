charon.plugins.dhcp.force_server_address = no
	Always use the configured server address.

	Always use the configured server address. This might be helpful if the DHCP
	server runs on the same host as strongSwan, and the DHCP daemon does not
	listen on the loopback interface.  In that case the server cannot be reached
	via unicast (or even 255.255.255.255) as that would be routed via loopback.
	Setting this option to yes and configuring the local broadcast address (e.g.
	192.168.0.255) as server address might work.

charon.plugins.dhcp.identity_lease = no
	Derive user-defined MAC address from hash of IKE identity and send client
	identity DHCP option.

charon.plugins.dhcp.release_on_delete = yes
	Send DHCPRELEASE message to DHCP server when IKE_SA is deleted. When
	set to "no", a DHCPRELEASE message is not sent and clients have a good chance
	of receiving the same IP address from the DHCP server if they return before the
	DHCP lease expires.

charon.plugins.dhcp.server = 255.255.255.255
	DHCP server unicast or broadcast IP address.

charon.plugins.dhcp.use_server_port = no
	Use the DHCP server port (67) as source port when a unicast server address
	is configured.

	Use the DHCP server port (67) as source port, instead of the DHCP client
	port (68), when a unicast server address is configured and the plugin acts
	as relay agent.  When replying in this mode the DHCP server will always send
	packets to the DHCP server port and if no process binds that port an ICMP
	port unreachables will be sent back, which might be problematic for some
	DHCP servers.  To avoid that, enabling this option will cause the plugin to
	bind the DHCP server port to send its requests when acting as relay agent.
	This is not necessary if a DHCP server is already running on the same host
	and might even cause conflicts (and since the server port is already bound,
	ICMPs should not be an issue).

charon.plugins.dhcp.interface
	Interface name the plugin uses for address allocation.

	Interface name the plugin uses for address allocation. The default is to
	bind to any (0.0.0.0) and let the system decide which way to route the
	packets to the DHCP server.
