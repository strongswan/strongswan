charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.buflen = <min(PAGE_SIZE, 8192)>
	Buffer size for received Netlink messages.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.fwmark =
	Firewall mark to set on the routing rule that directs traffic to our routing
	table.

	Firewall mark to set on the routing rule that directs traffic to our routing
	table. The format is [!]mark[/mask], where the optional exclamation mark
	inverts the meaning (i.e. the rule only applies to packets that don't match
	the mark).

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.mss = 0
	MSS to set on installed routes, 0 to disable.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.mtu = 0
	MTU to set on installed routes, 0 to disable.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.parallel_route = no
	Whether to perform concurrent Netlink ROUTE queries on a single socket.

	Whether to perform concurrent Netlink ROUTE queries on a single socket.
	While parallel queries can improve throughput, it has more overhead. On
	vanilla Linux, DUMP queries fail with EBUSY and must be retried, further
	decreasing performance.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.parallel_xfrm = no
	Whether to perform concurrent Netlink XFRM queries on a single socket.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.policy_update = no
	Whether to always use XFRM_MSG_UPDPOLICY to install policies.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.port_bypass = no
	Whether to use port or socket based IKE XFRM bypass policies.

	Whether to use port or socket based IKE XFRM bypass policies.
	IKE bypass policies are used to exempt IKE traffic from XFRM processing.
	The default socket based policies are directly tied to the IKE UDP sockets,
	port based policies use global XFRM bypass policies for the used IKE UDP
	ports.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.roam_events = yes
	Whether to trigger roam events when interfaces, addresses or routes change.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.set_proto_port_transport_sa = no
	Whether to set protocol and ports in the selector installed on transport
	mode IPsec SAs in the kernel.

	Whether to set protocol and ports in the selector installed on transport
	mode IPsec SAs in the kernel. While doing so enforces policies for inbound
	traffic, it also prevents the use of a single IPsec SA by more than one
	traffic selector.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.spdh_thresh {}
	XFRM policy hashing threshold configuration for IPv4 and IPv6.

	XFRM policy hashing threshold configuration for IPv4 and IPv6.

	The section defines hashing thresholds to configure in the kernel during
	daemon startup. Each address family takes a threshold for the local subnet
	of an IPsec policy (src in out-policies, dst in in- and forward-policies)
	and the remote subnet (dst in out-policies, src in in- and
	forward-policies).

	If the subnet has more or equal net bits than the threshold, the first
	threshold bits are used to calculate a hash to lookup the policy.

	Policy hashing thresholds are not supported before Linux 3.18 and might
	conflict with socket policies before Linux 4.8.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.spdh_thresh.ipv4.lbits = 32
	Local subnet XFRM policy hashing threshold for IPv4.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.spdh_thresh.ipv4.rbits = 32
	Remote subnet XFRM policy hashing threshold for IPv4.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.spdh_thresh.ipv6.lbits = 128
	Local subnet XFRM policy hashing threshold for IPv6.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.spdh_thresh.ipv6.rbits = 128
	Remote subnet XFRM policy hashing threshold for IPv6.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.retries = 0
	Number of Netlink message retransmissions to send on timeout.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.timeout = 0
	Netlink message retransmission timeout, 0 to disable retransmissions.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.ignore_retransmit_errors = no
	Whether to ignore errors potentially resulting from a retransmission.

charon.plugins.kernel-netlink.xfrm_acq_expires = 165
	Lifetime of XFRM acquire state and allocated SPIs in kernel.

	Lifetime of XFRM acquire state created by the kernel when traffic matches a
	trap policy. The value gets written to /proc/sys/net/core/xfrm_acq_expires.
	Indirectly controls the delay between XFRM acquire messages triggered by the
	kernel for a trap policy. The same value is used as timeout for SPIs
	allocated by the kernel. The default value equals the default total
	retransmission timeout for IKE messages, see IKEv2 RETRANSMISSION
	in **strongswan.conf**(5).
