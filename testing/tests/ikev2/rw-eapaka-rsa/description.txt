The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> sets up a connection to gateway <b>moon</b>.
<b>carol</b> uses the <i>Extensible Authentication Protocol</i>
in association with the <i>Authentication and Key Agreement</i> protocol
(<b>EAP-AKA</b>) to authenticate against the gateway. This protocol is used
in UMTS, but here a secret from ipsec.secrets is used instead of a USIM/(R)UIM.
Gateway <b>moon</b> additionaly uses an RSA signature to authenticate itself
against <b>carol</b>.
