A connection between the subnets behind the gateways <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b> is set up.
Using the <b>forecast</b> plugin additionally all 224.0.0.251 mDNS multicasts are going
to be tunneled.
The authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b>. Upon the successful
establishment of the IPsec tunnel, mDNS multicasts sent by <b>alice</b> are
received by <b>bob</b> and vice versa whereas unfortunately multicasts originating
from the gateways <b>moon</b> and <b>sun</b> themselves are not tunneled.
