The roadwarrior <b>carol</b> and the gateway <b>moon</b> use the <b>botan</b>
plugin based on the <b>Botan</b> library for all cryptographical functions whereas
roadwarrior <b>dave</b> uses the <b>openssl</b> and <b>ml</b> plugins. The
authentication is based on <b>X.509 certificates</b> and the key exchange on
<b>ecp384-ke1_mlkem768</b> for <b>carol</b> and <b>ecp521-ke1_mlkem1024</b> for <b>dave</b>.

Upon the successful establishment of the IPsec tunnels, the updown script
automatically inserts iptables-based firewall rules that let pass the tunneled traffic.
In order to test both tunnel and firewall, both <b>carol</b> and <b>dave</b> ping
the client <b>alice</b> behind the gateway <b>moon</b>.
