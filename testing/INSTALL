1. Making the host system UML-capable
   ----------------------------------

   UML instances can be run on both Linux 2.4 and Linux 2.6 kernels.
   If you are using a vanilla kernel from kernel.org then you must first
   apply the host SKAS patch available from

    http://www.user-mode-linux.org/~blaisorblade/patches/

   and recompile and reboot your host kernel. Some Linux distributions as e.g.
   SuSE already include the SKAS patch in their kernels.

   You will also need the UML utilities (uml_mconsole and uml_switch)
   available from

   http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/user-mode-linux/uml_utilities_20040406.tar.bz2

   Many Linux distributions offer the UML utilities as a package.


2. Installing the required files
   -----------------------------

First create a directory where you want the strongSwan UML testing environment
to be located.The default directory is "~/strongswan-testing". If you choose a
different location, please adapt the UMLTESTDIR variable in "testing.conf"
accordingly.

    mkdir ~/strongswan-testing

Now copy the "testing" subdirectory coming with the strongSwan distribution to
the UML testing environment:

    cp -r testing ~/strongswan-testing
   
Next you need to copy several files into the ~/strongswan-testing directory that
are required for the strongSwan testing environment:

    * A vanilla Linux kernel on which the UML kernel will be based on.
      We recommend the use of

      http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v2.6/linux-2.6.18.3.tar.bz2

    * Starting with Linux kernel 2.6.9 no patch must be applied any more in order
      to make the vanilla kernel UML-capable. For older kernels you'll find
      a matching UML patch at

      http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/user-mode-linux/

    * The matching .config file required to compile the UML kernel:

      http://download.strongswan.org/uml/.config-2.6.18

    * A gentoo-based UML file system (compressed size 130 MBytes) found at

      http://download.strongswan.org/uml/gentoo-fs-20061006.tar.bz2

    * The latest strongSwan distribution

      http://download.strongswan.org/strongswan-4.0.7.tar.gz


3. Creating the environment
   ------------------------

Now change into the testing subdirectory

    cd ~/strongswan-testing/testing

and make the UML testing environment:

    ./make-testing <hosts>

The "make-testing" script calls a series of subscripts which can be
enabled or disabled individually by setting the corresponding flags
in "testing.conf":

    if [ $ENABLE_BUILD_UMLKERNEL = "yes" ]
    then
        scripts/build-umlkernel
    fi

builds an UML kernel out of the vanilla Linux kernel and the corresponding
UML kernel patch.

    if [ $ENABLE_BUILD_HOSTCONFIG = "yes" ]
    then
        scripts/build-hostconfig
    fi

generates the default configurations for the UML hosts alice, venus, moon,
carol, winnetou, dave, sun, and bob by replacing the wildcards PH_IP_ALICE,
etc. by the actual IP addresses defined in "testing.conf".

    if [ $ENABLE_BUILD_UMLROOTFS = "yes" ]
    then
        scripts/build-umlrootfs
    fi

takes the gentoo-based UML file system and compiles the latest strongSwan
distribution into it.

    if [ $ENABLE_BUILD_SSHKEYS = "yes" ]
    then
        scripts/build-sshkeys
    fi

adds the common RSA public key of the UML instances to your ~/.ssh/known_hosts
directory so that you can log onto the UML instances using ssh without typing
in a password. The "scripts/build-sshkeys" script should only be run once.

    if [ $ENABLE_BUILD_UMLHOSTFS = "yes" ]
    then
        scripts/build-umlhostfs <hosts>
    fi

creates the customized UML file systems for the instances given as command line 
arguments by adding the default host configurations to the UML root file system.
If the "make-starting" scripts is called without any arguments then by default
the UML file systems are created for the hosts alice, venus, moon, carol,
winnetou, dave, sun, and bob. Each UML root file system has as size defined by
the ROOTFSSIZE in testing.conf which by default is 544 MBytes. Thus all 8 UML
hosts plus the master copy will require a total of 5 GBytes of disk space.

    if [ $ENABLE_START_TESTING = "yes" ]
    then
       ./start-testing <hosts>
    fi

starts the automated testing. More details on the tests you'll find in the
README document.
