#	"#< filename lineno" signals entry into that file
#	"#> filename lineno" signals return to that file
# The lineno is the line number of the *next* line.
#
# Errors are reported with a "#:message" line rather than on stderr.
#
# Lines which look like marker and report lines are never passed through.
