.SH NAME
pf_key \- shows pfkey messages emitted by the kernel
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pf_key
.B \-\-ah
.B \-\-esp
.B \-\-ipip
.B \-\-ipcomp
.B \-\-daemon 
.I file
.BR hmac-md5-96 | hmac-sha1-96
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pf_key
is a program to open a PF_KEY socket and print all messages that are received
from it. With no options, it will register itself to receive key requests for
AH, ESP, IPIP and IPCOMP security associations. If given more specific
options, then it will listen only to those protocols which are listed.
.PP
If the messages are recognized, the messages will be decoded.
.PP
If the option 
.B \-\-daemon
is provided, then after doing the registrations, the program will fork
into the background. The provided file will be opened and the process ID of
the background process will be written to it. This option is present to
present race conditions in regression testing.
.SH EXAMPLES
