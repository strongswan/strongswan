Opportunistic Encryption (OE) is the result of ongoing effort by the FreeS/WAN
project (www.freeswan.org). It allows for the creation of dynamic IPSec 
connections between hosts without pre-arrangement, authenticated via RSA keys 
stored in DNS records.

Technical information on OE can be found in this RFC draft:

http://www.freeswan.org/freeswan_snaps/CURRENT-SNAP/doc/draft-richardson-ipsec-opportunistic.txt

If you have any questions about these TXT records, or about OE in general, 
please direct them to the FreeS/WAN support lists:
